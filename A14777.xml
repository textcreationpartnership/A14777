            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN by the prouidence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, (courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) who ſweetly diſpoſeth all things, I was by two Purſuiuants apprehended the 24. of March 1607. after our Engliſh accompt, and committed to the Clinke by the Lord Biſhop of London on the 26. of the ſame moneth, 1608; I entred ſomewhat more deepely into the conſideration of the controuerſie of the Oath of allegiance, then before, whileſt I was at libertie, I had done. And preſently conſulting with ſome of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren whom I found there priſoners before my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, I thought it very expedient to informe the Popes Holineſſe of the lamentable eſtate of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, what miſeries and imminent dangers ſuch Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, as ſhould refuſe the Oath of allegiance, were like to fall into by reaſon of his Breues prohibiting them to take it; what diuiſion among Catholickes, what perturbation they were vndoubtedly to breed in the Church of England, (our dread Soueraigne being thereby not without iuſt cauſe exaſperated) hoping by ſuch meanes to procure a remedy before the malady
<pb facs="tcp:20220:3"/>grew too deſperate. But they more prudent, and better experienced in ſuch like Romane informations then my ſelfe, thought it better in their iudgements, and more expedient, with patience to expect future euents from Rome, and not ſo to proceed, as being to ſmall or no purpoſe at all.</p>
            <p>Hereupon I reſted ſatisfied, though ſorie in mind to conſider the manifold euils that were like to enſue, as long as theſe two principall powers, Eccleſiaſticall and ciuill, the Pope and our King, were at variance; and did not intend to ſet pen to paper of this matter; for that I knew my ſelfe the meaneſt among the reſt of my brethren that had taken the Oath, and becauſe I had (as I thought) in diſcharge of my particular duty, made ſufficient proofe of my loyaltie towards his Maieſtie, by accepting the Oath when it was required at my hands. In the end, aduiſed by a friend one of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to premeditate and prouide reaſons for our ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it, to be ſent to Rome; for it was to him more then probable he ſaid, that in ſhort ſpace after we ſhould receiue a commandement from his Holineſſe ſo to do: and deſirous withall to yeeld ſome ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the State, for the great ſcandall certaine of our brethren had giuen, by their perfidious inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in taking the Oath, &amp; anon after (being freed from troubles) relented and impugned (as hath bene repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) that which they ſeemed by their act to haue iudged lawfull: I reſolued vpon mature conſideration, to reduce into ſome method for helpe of my memorie, and ſatisfaction of a friend, certaine notes which in ſcattered papers I had collected co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this matter: not intending yet to publiſh them for feare firſt of
<pb facs="tcp:20220:3"/>offending ſome Catholikes, who pretending the Oath to be vnlawfull (though they know not well wherein, are ready with raſh cenſures to iudge and condemne, before ſentence of condemnation from the chiefe Iudge be giuen: but eſpecially I feared leſt I ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Popes Holineſſe, who in his Breues hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther admoniſhed or prohibited all Catholikes to take it, or to teach the lawfulneſſe thereof. At length know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my intention to be, not to offend any one, nor to contemne his Holineſſe commandement; but to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance, what in me lyeth, the glory of God, by ſetting downe ſincerely what in my iudgement is truth, and perſwading euery Catholike ſubiect to render to <hi>Caeſar</hi> thoſe things which are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> to performe his dutie to his Maieſtie in taking the Oath of allegiance, &amp; to ſeeke thereby to remoue the imputation of treachery and treaſon: I held it my dutie both to God and man, to breake ſilence, to caſt away this humane feare, and to put on the mantle of charitie, <hi>quae foras mittit timorem.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4</note> Howbeit (gentle reader) whileſt I meditated to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in theſe my labours, for the benefite of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Chriſt the Catholikes of England, ſodainly that queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our B. Sauiour, as it were to deterre me from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, came into my mind: <hi>Quis ex vobis volens tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim aedificare:</hi> Which of you minding to build a tower, doth not firſt ſit downe and recken the charges that are neceſſarie, whether he haue to finiſh it: leſt, after he hath laied the foundation, and is not able to finiſh it, all that ſee it, begin to mocke him, ſaying, That this man began to build, and he could not finiſh it? I forthwith ſtayed, and caſt my accompts, that is, I weighed the ſmall meanes I had to relieue me taking paines, my
<pb facs="tcp:20220:4"/>infirme and feeble body, ſlender furniture of bookes, and many interrupted diſtractions which my pouerty in priſon miniſtred vnto me, and conſidered whether I might be able to bring this ſhort treatiſe to an end, &amp; ſo auoide that illuſion: <hi>This man beganne to build, and he could not finiſh it.</hi> Then though my meanes and abilitie euery way I knew to be ſmall, yet truſting in the aſſiſtance of almightie God, whoſe glorie hereby I principally ſeeke, and is the chiefeſt reaſon of this my proceſſe, I was by and by encouraged to attempt the defending of this Oath, (which I iudged farre beyond my talent) calling to remembrance that of the Prophet: <hi>In Deo meo tranſgrediar murum:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 17.</note> In my God I will paſſe ouer a wall.<note place="margin">Philip 4.</note> And the ſaying of S. <hi>Paule: Omnia poſſum in eo qui me confortat.</hi> I can do all things in him (that is, through his helpe) that ſtrengtheneth me: nothing doubting alſo but,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. v. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Qui operatus eſt in me velle, operaretur &amp; perficere pro bona voluntate.</hi> He that wrought in me to will, would likewiſe worke to accompliſh according to his good will. Vpon this confidence then of Gods aſſiſtance, and for the inſtruction of certaine Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, who ſimply beleeue the inconſiderat aſſertions of ſome of their teachers; that ſuch as take the Oath, do, and muſt renounce the Popes ſpirituall auctoritie of excommunication; and abiure or condemne for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie a diſputable poſition, to wit, that the Pope may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for hereſie or apoſtacie; which is moſt vntrue, as will eaſily appeare to him that without paſſion and with iudgement ſhall reade the Oath, or this my booke. Theſe and ſuch like I exhort not to be too credulous in a matter of ſo great moment as this is, giuing eare to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one that will ſay, it may not be taken, and can ſhew
<pb facs="tcp:20220:4"/>them no true reaſon why, nor in what point it is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. If any liſt wilfully to reiect this my wholſome counſaile, and will rather ſtill giue eare to ſuch as worke their ouerthrow, what elſe can they in reaſon expect but loſſe of lands and goods, perpetuall impriſonment by the law, finall deſtruction to them and theirs, and haply get no merite to benefite their ſoules, if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie (in clemencie excelling) be much exaſperated? which with carefull regard ought to be looked vnto, becauſe, <hi>Qui nimium emungit, elicet ſanguinem:</hi> He that ſtraineth too much, draweth bloud. And may not his Princely Maieſtie be well ſayd to excell in mercie and clemencie, who firſt with ſpeede vpon the diſcouery of the Gun-powder treaſon, ſet forth his Proclamation worthy neuer to be forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, therby to ſtay the furie of the people, readie doubtleſſe at that time to haue mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered all that ſhould beare the name of Catholike, without reſpecting who were innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or who were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent? &amp; after, himſelfe,<note place="margin">Suetonius in Auguſto.</note> as <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> in perſon plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the life of a ſouldier, by his pen interpreting the Oath of allegia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, pleaded as it were (to giue ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his Royall meaning &amp; intent of the law) for ſuch as he needed not ſo farre to condeſcend vnto?

            <head>TO THE CATHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LICKES OF ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloued brethren in Chriſt Ieſus: Whereas the Kings moſt excellent Maieſtie, being the true, lawful, and right inheritour to the Crowne and Realme of England, by the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of almightie God entred and poſſeſſed the ſame with tranquillity and peace, and the great applauſe of all his ſubiects, as well Catholickes as Proteſtants, or others of different ſects and opinions: his Highneſſe, as it were to requite their dutifull affection, forthwith gaue great hope of a moſt happie and proſperous regiment; and out of his bountie and clemencie extended many his moſt royall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours indifferently vpon all, till ſuch time as ſome of the one ſort (to wit, a few giddie headed, deſperate, and diſloyall Catholicks aſſociated with certaine of the <hi>Societie</hi>) prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked his wrath and indignation againſt them, yea and all the profeſſors of the ſame religion for their fact. Who was not moued (as all men will confeſſe) without iuſt cauſe, for that they (viz. Catholickes) onely either concealed, or moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly attempted in that helliſh-like manner of gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fire (the memorie whereof muſt needs remaine for euer moſt grieuous to all true hearted Catholike ſubiects) the cruell murther of ſo many worthie Commons, and Noble perſonages, in Parliament aſſembled; yea of the moſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and innocent yong Prince, the Queene, and King himſelfe: and then ſoone after alſo had followed vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly the deſolation, ruine, and deſtruction of the whole
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20220:8"/>realme of England.</p>
            <p>Hereupon by the generall conſent of all three eſtates and the Kings Maieſtie, it was thought neceſſarie, an Oath of allegeance in ſuch forme ſhould be framed and enacted, as Catholikes (for whom chiefly it was made) ſhould haue no cauſe ſcrupulouſly to refuſe to take the ſame; and the Kings Highneſſe with his whole eſtate might be better ſecured, and freed from all feares and dangers: imitating herein other Kings and Princes as occaſions ſhall be offered them.</p>
            <p>If euer the Kings of France or Spaine, or other Princes whatſoeuer had cauſe to exact an Oath of fealtie of their ſubiects for ſafetie of their perſons or ſtate; then certes no man that hath but common ſenſe will denie but our King hath more then iuſt, vpon ſo horrible and monſtrous cauſe giuen, as the like haply was neuer heard of from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world.</p>
            <p>Could any man haue thought it ſtrange, or held it cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if, being in ſuch wiſe, and by ſuch perſons prouoked, he had in his wrath and indignation rigorouſly proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all others of the Romane religion, as ſuſpecting them to beare no better mind towards him? though manie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands doubtleſſe no way conſented, nor were euer priuie to that horrible fact.</p>
            <p>And if he had, what ruine of Catholike families, what ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocke of Chriſtian bloud, with the deſtruction of ſoules, and other infinite miſeries ſhould we haue ſeene? But the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent God (whoſe name be bleſſed for euer) who hath the rule and gouernment of the hearts of Kings, inclined his royall heart to mercie and compaſſion of his ſubiects, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right well the faith and loyaltie of many of the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as his Maieſtie moſt benignely expreſſed in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation; and that he ſhould haue puniſhed the innocent with the nocent, as well his friends as his foes. Oh what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie were it for a man to wake a ſleeping Lion, or ſtirre a neſt of waſpes or hornets, whereby he might endanger himſelfe to be bitten or ſtong moſt grieuouſly? Then how much greater is the follie of ſuch, as feare not to irritate or incenſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20220:8"/>a King, who naturally deſireth nothing more then peace and quietneſſe to himſelfe and his people? We learne in holy writ how dreadfull is the terror of a King, in that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the roaring of a Lion:<note place="margin">Prou. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Sicut rugitus Leonis, ita &amp; terror Regis: qui prouocat eum, peccat in animam ſuam.</hi> As the roaring of a Lion, ſo is the terrour of a King: he that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh him offendeth againſt his owne life.</p>
            <p>Example we haue of King <hi>Dauid,</hi> who was ſtirred to wrath by <hi>Hanon</hi> King of Ammonites vpon ingratitude for his loue and kindneſſe. For, <hi>Dauid</hi> hearing of his fathers death, ſent ſome of his ſeruants to comfort him: <hi>Hanon</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing euill counſell, forſooth, that Dauid did not ſend to condole with him and comfort him, but to eſpie the Citie and ouerthrow it. Whereupon moſt vngratefully he euill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the embaſſadours, ſhauing halfe their beards, and ignominiouſly cutting their garments vnto the buttockes. King <hi>Dauid</hi> herewith moued to anger, prouided an armie to reuenge this iniurie; ouerthrew of the Syrians that aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the Ammonites ſeuen thouſand chariots, and ſlue forty thouſand footmen, made hauock of the Ammonites bloud, and waſted the cities of King <hi>Hanon,</hi> deſtroying the people in moſt rufull maner: as you may reade in the ſecond booke of the Kings and Paralipomenon.<note place="margin">2. Reg. 10. 1.

Wickedneſſe, in rendring euill for good, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing warres (the euent whereof is various) which was cauſe that many innocent perſons, who were not conſenting to <hi>Hanons,</hi> fact, nor euer haply wiſhed <hi>Dauid</hi> hurt, were in that fury ſlaine.</p>
            <p>We reade likewiſe how this holy king <hi>Dauid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Reg. 25.</note> being in the deſert perſecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> purpoſed and prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge himſelfe on malicious <hi>Nabal,</hi> for contemning him and his ſeruants (whom in his diſtreſſe he had ſent in peaceable and friendly ſort for victuals and reliefe) ſaying, Who is <hi>Dauid?</hi> and what is the ſonne of <hi>Iſai?</hi> There are ſeruants mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20220:9"/>now a dayes, which flie from their maiſters. Shall I then take my breads, and my waters, and the fleſh of my cattell which I haue killed for my ſhearers, and giue it to men whom I know not whence they are? Hereupon <hi>Dauid</hi> in wrath ſet forward to be reuenged, and purpoſed not to haue left nor <hi>Nabal,</hi> nor any belonging to him, to piſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a wall, had not his wife <hi>Abigail</hi> by her wiſedome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented the ſhedding of innocent blood, meeting with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> and pacifying him with gifts, prudent ſpeeches, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete behauiour.</p>
            <p>In the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie is likewiſe noted,<note place="margin">Theod. lib. 5. cap. 17.</note> how that renowmed Emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> vpon rage cauſed many innocents in Theſſalonica to be put to death, for the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of one Noble man of his court.

            <p>If king <hi>Dauid</hi> or <hi>Theodoſius</hi> might pretend iuſt cauſe to reuenge their wrongs in ſuch ſort by ſeuere puniſhment not onely of the offenders, but alſo of the guiltleſſe: then ſurely none can deny but king <hi>Iames</hi> our dread Soueraigne had much more againſt the conſpirators in the notorious gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder-treaſon, and many others of the ſame religion, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he might well ſuſpect to be of the ſame confederation. In this, there was not a contempt onely of his ſeruants, nor a ſhauing of beards, or paring their garments to the buttocks, nor yet the murthering of one of his Nobles: but (out alas) here was intended a moſt pitifull ſlaughter of the Kings owne perſon, the Queene his wife, the yong Prince his ſonne, the Nobilitie, and people in great numbers: and then eftſoones had followed a finall deſtruction of infinite ſoules and bodies, and of this whole floriſhing kingdome; as euery one that is but meanely wiſe muſt needes know.

The cauſe then wherefore this Oath of allegeance was made, no man can doubt but the moſt barbarous Gun-powder conſpiracy was the onely vrgent motiue, it neuer being (in common knowledge) ſo much as thought of before. The ſcope and end thereof was, that by taking or refuſing the ſame, the King and State might diſtinguiſh betweene true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and hollow-hearted Catholicke ſubiects:<note place="margin">Regis Praemo, pag. 12.</note> and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie might be more fully aſſured of their conſtancie and fidelitie in time of need, vpon any cauſe to be offered what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer; or by Prince, people, Pope, or whoſoeuer.</p>
            <p>And can any man maruell, that the Pope is therein na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? Doth this ſcandalize any? Conſider but what they were that inſerted it; the time, and place, and pretence of reaſon they had or might haue to imagine (being ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe or oppoſite to him in religion, and the Treaſon ſo freſh in memorie) that his Holineſſe might giue leaue or encouragement, or at leaſt be priuie, and ſo to winke at ſuch an attempt; preſuming that no Catholicke durſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe ſuch a fact, without conniuence at leaſt of ſupreme authoritie. And had they not cauſe to feare or doubt him more then any other, none being therein culpable but only Ieſuites and Catholickes; of whom, ſome haply thinke themſelues bound to obey him whatſoeuer he command, for that in their opinion he cannot erre in commanding? Howbeit we that are by Gods grace Catholicks alſo, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all points with Chriſt his Vicar the Pope of Rome, in vnitie of faith, do no way ſuſpect that euer he was conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, much leſſe gaue way to authorize ſuch enormous and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20220:11"/>wicked deſignements: though withall we diſſent from them that thinke he cannot erre, no not in a matter of fact. The State there aſſembled, were not ſuch babes, as that they needed be taught of the Pope his proceedings with Princes about their depriuations or depoſitions for diuers crimes, when he hath hope to preuaile, but eſpecially for hereſie or apoſtaſie. They knew right well likewiſe, that if his Highnes ſhould be by his Holineſſe denounced and declared an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticke, what dangers might ſoone after enſue: therefore was it thought wiſedome to preuent a miſchiefe ere it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, in exacting an Oath of allegeance at Catholicks hands, in that maner and forme as it is ſet downe, thereby more firmly to binde them to the performance of their dutie, whereto otherwiſe by the law of God and nature they reſt obliged. For it is to be preſumed, that a Chriſtian, an honeſt man, that hath feare of Gods iudgements, wil not become perfidious, nor raſhly or vniuſtly breake that oath, which diſcreetly and iuſtly he conſented to take. <hi>Iurabit proximo ſuo,</hi>

            <p> Beloued brethren, I truſt you expect not at my hands that I ſhould fully and exactly diſcuſſe euery point of the Oath, and anſwer euery ſcrupulous difficultie that ſome vſe to make (albeit it might be eaſie to effect:) for it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a better librarie then mine is at this preſent, more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour then I can well affoord, by reaſon of my feeble bodie, and a larger treatiſe then I meane to make. Your deſire is (as I preſume) onely to know whether the principall points thereof, as depoſing the Kings Maieſtie, diſcharging his ſubiects of their obedience, diſpenſing and abſoluing in this Oath, and ſuch like, be matter of faith, which bind e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Chriſtian man ſtedfaſtly to beleeue the ſame, vnder paine of damnation; or elſe but matter of opinion. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, what you ought to doe concerning the Popes Breues, whether you may lawfully diſobey them or no. Theſe points indeed are the chiefeſt, whereon the reſt haue their dependa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which with Gods aſſiſtance I ſhal endeuor ſo to handle, as you ſhall not need to doubt of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Oath, nor hazard all your eſtates for refuſing the ſame; yet ſo, as whatſoeuer ſhall be here in this my treatiſe written, I humbly ſubmit to the cenſure of the holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke and Apoſtolicke Church. <hi>Errare quidem poſſum, homo enim ſum, haereticus eſſe nolo:</hi> Well I may erre, for a man I am, but hereticke will I neuer be.</p>
            <p>In the dayes of <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet, after the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had bene foure hundred yeares ruled and gouerned by certaine rulers called Iudges, vpon occaſion of <hi>Samuels</hi> ſonnes miſdemeanour in their gouernment,<note place="margin">1.

               <note place="margin">Gloſſ. ordin. in hunc locu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> are a Kings right (as faith the Gloſſe) in time of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20220:12"/>neede, for the good of the weale publike; though it were to be wiſhed that many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were moderatly vſed,<note place="margin">Tho. 1. 2. q. 105. at. 1. ad 5</note> eſpecially all thoſe things which ſeeme to make the people that is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, to be ſeruile or ſlauiſh; and which reſpect not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, but rather the will of the man exalted in the kingdome. Theſe or ſuch like did <hi>Samuel</hi> foretell them, to withdraw them from asking a king, becauſe it was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for them: and becauſe, that gouernment for the greatneſſe or excellencie of power, is eaſily conuerted into tyrannie.</p>
            <p>After this, God ſent <hi>Saul,</hi> and then reuealed vnto <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> that he was the king that ſhould gouerne his people-Iſrael, and commanded to annoint him. Which he did, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Ecce vnxit te Dominus ſuper haereditatem ſuam in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Reg. 10.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; liberabis populum ſuum de manibus inimicoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eius qui in circuitu eius ſunt.</hi> Behold our Lord hath annointed thee to be Prince ouer his inheritance, and thou ſhalt deliuer his people from the hands of their enemies which are round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them. Not long after, king <hi>Saul</hi> for diſobeying the precept of God giuen him by <hi>Samuel,</hi> was by God depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of his kingdome, as the Scripture ſaith, and not by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> as ſome would haue it.<note place="margin">1.

               <hi>Quia proieciſti ſermonem Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, &amp; proiecit te Dominus ne ſis Rex ſuper Iſrael.</hi> Becauſe thou haſt reiected the word of our Lord, our Lord alſo hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected thee, that thou maieſt not be king ouer Iſrael.</p>
            <p>By this example ſome gather (as they thinke) a ſtrong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>viz. à fortiori,</hi> that the Church of God, and the Pope, Chriſts vicar in earth, may iuſtly depriue or diſpoſſeſſe kings of their ſcepters and dominions vpon cauſe giuen, as for hereſie or apoſtaſie, &amp;c. when as the Synagogue and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> had this authoritie, who <hi>de facto</hi> depoſed <hi>Saul</hi> for diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience onely.</p>
            <p>If this were true, then indeede were the argument of ſome force; for it cannot be denied, but that the ſpirituall power of the Church of Chriſt, is much greater then was that of the Synagogue of the Iewes, and the Pope hath more ample * ordinarie authoritie then <hi>Samuel</hi> had: yet it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20220:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>followeth not hereof, that either the Pope, or Church, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny power receiued from Chriſt Ieſus, can depriue, depoſe, or diſpoſſes any lawfull Prince or priuate man, that is not a vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, feudatarie or ſubiect vnto him, of his goods temporall, ſtate, crowne, or dignitie: becauſe neither the Synagogue, nor <hi>Samuel</hi> were euer endued with this power. It is not any where to be found in all the old Teſtament that the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of the Iewes (the figure of Chriſts Church) or high Prieſt or Biſhop for the time being, could, or <hi>de facto</hi> euer did depoſe any lawfull king of Iſrael or Iuda from their Empire, were he neuer ſo wicked, neuer ſo peruerſe or cruell, and in his place did ſubſtitute an other. Whereby then is euident, that no good argument can be gathered by this example, to proue ſuch power to be in the new law, and in the Church or gouernours thereof.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Samuel</hi> depoſed not king <hi>Saul</hi> by any authoritie in him exiſting, but Almightie God himſelfe, may eaſily be proued thus: for either he muſt depoſe him by temporall authoritie as he was a Iudge, which could not be, he being depriued thereof when <hi>Saul</hi> was made king, and was no more a gouernour but a ſubiect; or elſe by ſome ordinarie power of ſpirituall iuriſdiction ouer him, which he had not, for that he was nor Biſhop nor Prieſt (though a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) but only a Leuite, as <hi>Genebrard,</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Geneb. in Pſ. 98. Hierom. lib. 1. in louin Bellar. in Pſal. 98.

Therefore <hi>Samuel</hi> depoſed him not, but onely as an extraordinarie Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor executed the will and iudgement of God in his depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, who had giuen him a ſpeciall warrant or commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as touching the ſame, which will appeare manifeſtly to him that readeth the Scripture: <hi>Sine me, &amp; indicabo tibi quae locutus eſt Dominus ad me nocte.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Reg. 15.</note> Suffer me (ſaid <hi>Samuel</hi> to the king when he came to him) and I will declare vnto you what our Lord hath ſpoken to me in the night. And then forthwith deliuered his meſſage, that which God had reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto him, to wit, that our Lord had ſo reiected him and his progenie, as (albeit he were in perſon to enioy the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20220:13"/>to his liues end, as he did fortie yeares) that none of his ſtocke or ſeed ſhould ſucceſſiuely reigne after him, and be of that line of whom Chriſt the Meſſias was to be incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
            <p>If then neither the Synagogue nor <hi>Samuel</hi> did, or could by any ordinarie power depoſe <hi>Saul,</hi> elected by God, I do not ſee how by this example any good argument can be drawne in conſequence for the Churches, or the Popes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie power of depoſing Princes. Had ſuch authoritie bin graunted to the Synagogue or high Prieſts in the old law, why I pray you had it not bene practiſed on the perſons of <hi>Achaz, Manaſſes, Amon, Ioachaz,</hi> and other kings of Iuda, who were much more wicked then <hi>Saul</hi> was? and on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious <hi>Ieroboam</hi> that led with him all Iſrael to Idolatrie? <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab, Ochozias, Ioachaz,</hi> and the reſt of the kings of Iſrael, who exceeded in all kind of impietie? in whoſe dayes flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed <hi>Ahias, Semeias, Elias, Eliſeus, Iſaias, Ieremy,</hi> and other great Prophets, indued with maruellous courage, zeale, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and ſanctitie of life; yet none went about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or take the crowne from the head of any Prince law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inueſted, though he were neuer ſo wicked: knowing right well, that whatſoeuer they wrought with Princes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ouerthrow of ſome, or ſetting vp of others, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told what was to happen vnto them; it was not by any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie power that they had, but extraordinary, by ſpeciall commandement and reuelation from Almightie God. Now by this fact of <hi>Samuel</hi> it may well be deduced, that whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the Pope, gouernour of Gods houſe, ſhall haue ſpeciall reuelation from aboue, as <hi>Samuel</hi> had, that ſuch a particular king is to be depoſed, and another placed in his roome; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it cannot be denied but he may do as <hi>Samuel</hi> did, that is, as I haue ſaid, he may and ought to declare the will of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto him without any concurrence to the execution thereof, onely denouncing Gods ſentence of deiection or depoſition of ſuch a Prince, when he knoweth certainly, that ſo is the will and pleaſure of our Lord, whoſe will none may contradict. <hi>Voluntati eius quis reſiſtit?</hi> Who is able to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20220:13"/>reſiſt his will? nor is any to expoſtulate why he doth ſo. And if ſuch a thing ſhould euer happen, then were the argument good and ſound, otherwiſe, weake, and of no force.</p>
            <p>If any man after this, obiect vnto me, that <hi>Athalia</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and ſlaine by the commandement of <hi>Ioiada</hi> the high Prieſt, when ſhe had reigned ſeuen yeares: therefore it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth he had authoritie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ſo to do; and if he had, why ſhould not the Pope haue the like ouer exorbitant Princes?</p>
            <p>For ſolution hereof, I referre him to the place of holy Scripture, where he may ſee with halfe an eye,<note place="margin">4. Reg. 11.</note> that <hi>Athalia</hi> was no lawfull Queene, but an vſurping tyrant; who had murthered all the kingly race, and ſo intruded her ſelfe moſt vniuſtly. Whereupon <hi>Ioiada,</hi> high Prieſt, brought forth, and preſented to the people <hi>Ioas,</hi> ſonne to <hi>Ochozias,</hi> who was ſtrangely preſerued, by meanes of his Aunt <hi>Ioſaba,</hi> when he was but an infant, from that tyrannous ſlaughter made by his Grandmother <hi>Athalia;</hi> and together with their full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, performing the dutie of a good ſubiect, reſtored the true heire to the right of his kingdome; which could hardly haue bene effected without the high Prieſts aſſiſtance, who was the chiefeſt in matters of religion; and therefore much honoured and reſpected of the people. So this fact of <hi>Ioiada</hi> proueth nothing, but that it is lawfull for a ſtate or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth to depoſe an vſurper, and reſtore the true heire to his right; and not that he had any authoritie to depoſe any lawfull Prince, were he otherwiſe neuer ſo exorbitant in life, manners and beleefe, or cruell in his gouernment.</p>
            <p>Well Sir, though this be granted, that neither the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of the Iewes, nor <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet, nor <hi>Ioiada</hi> the high Prieſt, had authoritie to depoſe Princes and diſpoſe of their temporals; yet can we not be perſwaded but that the Church of Chriſt, and his Vicar in earth the Pope (whoſe power is not limited to one ſort of people, as it was in the old law, but is extended ouer all Chriſtians, as well Princes as people, throughout the world) may iuſtly depoſe kings and diſpoſe of their kingdomes, when he ſhall iudge it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to the glory of God, and vtilitie of the Church.

By this you may ſee, that the Pope hath his temporalities and temporall power, not from Chriſt, but from <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and other Chriſtian Princes and people, and was euer ſubiect to ciuill gouernment of Emperours, till ſuch time as by their graunts he was made a King and temporall Prince, and ſo had no ſuperiour; and that Clerks (as parts of the political co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth) are bound to obey al iuſt lawes of the ſame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth no leſſe then the Laitie: but more of this in another place, as occaſion ſhall ſerue. Now to come ſomewhat nearer the queſtion that I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and you deſire to be reſolued on, as touching the Popes authoritie to depoſe Princes of their temporall dominions: Firſt you are to note, that of this matter there are two opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions much different the one from the other, one of the Canoniſts, another of Diuines. The Canoniſts hold it for true doctrine to be maintained,<note place="margin">Tho. Bozius. Carerius. D. Marta. and others.</note> that all power whatſoeuer is in this world, either temporall and ciuill, or ſpirituall and eccleſiaſticall, was giuen directly by Chriſt to <hi>Peter</hi> and his ſucceſſors; and what power any Kings or Princes in the whole world, either Chriſtians or Infidels haue, it all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth of the Pope, and is deriued from him to them, as touching the temporall execution: ſo that as Lord of the world, he may depoſe Princes, take away their kingdomes and principalities, and giue or diſpoſe them to whom he liſt, though no man know the cauſe why he doth ſo; if he ſhall iudge there is ſufficient cauſe to do it. If this were true doctrine, then woe to all Princes that ſhould at any time yea but breake amitie and friendſhip with him that ſitteth in <hi>Peters</hi> ſeate: what ſecuritie could they haue of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates? Then might they expect, of Princes and rulers to be made priuate men and ſubiects; then may it be granted that our Soueraigne were not vnlike to be depriued of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, his ſubiects to be diſcharged of their obedience, and his territories giuen in prey to his enemies. But this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is held to be moſt falſe by many Diuines, becauſe it cannot be proued either by authoritie of Scripture, or by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20220:16"/>tradition of the Apoſtles, or practiſe of the ancient Church, or by the doctrine and teſtimonies of the ancient Fathers. Howbeit <hi>Bozius</hi> a late writer moſt ſtoutly defendeth the ſame,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 11</note> and greatly blameth many excellent Diuines (among whom is renowmed Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) and calleth them new diuines, ſaying moreouer, that they teach moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly falſe doctrine,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. cap. vlt.</note> and repugnant to all truth, becauſe they ſay that Chriſt as man, was neuer a temporall king, nor had any temporall dominion on earth, nor did exerciſe or practiſe any regall power, (for by theſe aſſertions, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall foundations of <hi>Bozius</hi> friuolous arguments are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne) which as moſt true they confirme by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Sauiour himſelfe.<note place="margin">Math. 8. Luc. 9.</note> Foxes (ſaith he) haue holes, and the foules of the aire neſts, but the Sonne of man hath not where to put his head. If Chriſt Ieſus as he was the ſon of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had not ſo much in this world as a cottage to reſt himſelf in: where I pray you is his kingdome? where is his temporall dominion? who can conceiue that one can be king and Lord, who hath no kingdome or Lordſhip in the vniuerſall world?

Therefore I meane not to ſtand to confute this opinion of Canoniſts, which hath bene moſt learnedly confuted by Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 5. de ſum Pont. c. 2. &amp; 3</note> but to let it paſſe as moſt abſurd, that cannot be proued by any ſound reaſon, nor ancient authorities either of Scriptures, Fathers, or Councels; but maintained by captious fallacies, vnapt ſimilitudes, and corrupt interpretations.</p>
            <p>An other opinion there is of Diuines, who diſlike, and with moſt ſtrong reaſons do confute the Canoniſts poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but yet ſo as they vphold and labour to maintain the Popes temporall power, though in other ſort then the former, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">De Ro. Pont. lib. 5. c. 6.</note> indirectly, or caſually and by conſequence. This then they write, and namely Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine: Aſſerimus, Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificem,

And againe in the ſame chapter: <hi>Quantum ad perſonas, non poteſt Papa, vt Papa, ordinariè tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porales Principes deponere, etiam iuſta decauſa, eo modo quo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponit Epiſcopos, id eſt, tanquam ordinarius iudex, &amp;c.</hi> As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the perſons, the Pope as Pope cannot ordinarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe temporall Princes, yea for a iuſt cauſe, after that ſort as he depoſeth Biſhops, that is, as an ordinary iudge: yet he may change kingdomes, and take from one, and giue to an other as the chiefe ſpirituall Prince, if that be neceſſarie to the health or ſauing of ſoules. And in the ſame booke the firſt chapter, where he putteth downe the Catholicke opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (as he ſaith) he altereth it ſomewhat in this manner. <hi>Pontificem vt Pontificem, &amp;c.</hi> That the Pope as Pope,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. cap. 1.</note> hath not directly and immediatly any temporall power, but only ſpirituall; yet by reaſon of the ſpirituall, he hath at leaſt indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly a certaine power, &amp; that chiefe or higheſt in te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porals.</p>
            <p>You haue here ſet downe by Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the opinion of Diuines, that the Pope as Pope, or chiefe Biſhop as chiefe Biſhop, hath not directly and immediatly any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall power to depoſe Chriſtian Princes, but that indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I wot not how, he may depoſe them, and diſpoſe of their temporals: and ſo in effect, and after a ſort, agreeeth with the Canoniſts, that indeed ſuch power is rightly in him; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he differeth about the manner, with a reſtraint, from infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels to Chriſtian Princes. But I truſt, as he in improuing the Canoniſts aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of direct power ouer al the world, driueth them to Scriptures, or tradition of the Apoſtles; ſo likewiſe we may require that he proue his indirect power by one of theſe two wayes. If he cannot, as moſt certainely he cannot, then why ſhould men giue more credite to him then to the other, they being as Catholike, and haply no leſſe lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20220:17"/>then he? Why ſhould his opinion be thought more true then the former? To diſproue the Canoniſts thus he writeth: <hi>Ex Scriptur is nihil habemus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bellar de Ro. Pont l. 5. c. 3.</note> 
               <hi>niſi datas Pontifici claues regni coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum, declauibus regni terrarium nulla mention fit. Traditionem Apoſtolicam nullam aduerſary proferunt.</hi> Out of Scriptures we haue nothing, but that the keyes of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen were giuen to the Pope, of the keyes of the kingdome of the earth no mention is made at all. Apoſtolical tradition our aduerſaries produce none. Hereby it ſeemeth the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall goeth about to proue againſt his aduerſaries, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the keyes of the kingdome of the earth are no where mentioned in the Scripture to be giuen to <hi>Peter</hi> and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors, therefore the Pope hath not any direct authoritie to depoſe the Princes of the world, nor diſpoſe of their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals: inſinuating that the keyes of the kingdome of heauen promiſed and granted to <hi>Peter</hi> (or to the Church in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Peter</hi>) can worke no ſuch effect, nor were granted to depriue Chriſtian Princes or others of their ſcepters and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall dignities; but onely by cenſures and ſpirituall authority to exclude vnworthy ſinners from eternall felicitie, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch as are truly penitent to the kingdome of heauen. If this argument be good againſt the Canoniſts, then why is it not alſo good againſt Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe, when as he can no more produce Apoſtolicall tradition to confirme his indirect authoritie, then the other their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect? And of the keyes of the kingdome of the earth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for depoſing Princes and diſpoſing of temporals, no mention is made in all the Scriptures, no not for his indirect or caſuall authoritie.</p>
            <p>Conſider beſides I pray you (for it is worth the noting) how obſcurely and ambiguouſly, he writeth of the Popes power to depoſe, thereby haply intending to ſeeke ſome ſtarting hole of equiuocation if occaſion ſerue; and meane while leaue his reader doubtfull, and ſtill to ſeeke of his meaning, which in my ſimple Judgement is ſuch as the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious wit can hardly conceiue, nor tell what he would ſay. As for example, that the chiefe Biſhop as chiefe Biſhop
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20220:17"/>hath not any power meerly temporall, &amp;c. as is noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lib. 5. cap. 6. and in the ſame chapter: The Pope as Pope cannot ordinarily (note) depoſe, &amp;c. no not for a iuſt cauſe: mary as he is the chiefe ſpirituall Prince he may depoſe and diſpoſe, &amp;c. Helpe me good Reader to vnderſtand this rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, how theſe two differ in ſome eſſentiall point, Pope, and chiefe ſpirituall Prince. I muſt confeſſe that I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not how he is the chiefe ſpirituall Prince, but as he is Pope, that is, the Father of Fathers, or chiefe Paſtor of ſoules in the Church of God. It is wel knowne that this title Pope, or <hi>Papa</hi> in Latin, hath bene attributed to many ancient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs and Biſhops, as well as to the Biſhop of Rome (though principally to him, and now is appropriated to him alone) and for nought elſe, but for being Biſhops and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Princes of the Church: and for that cauſe only, &amp; not for being a temporal Prince, <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, hath his denomination. Which in effect D. <hi>Kelliſon</hi> affirmeth, ſaying:<note place="margin">D. Kelliſons Reply to M. Sutel. ca. 1. f. 9. Bern. lib. 2. de conſid.</note> I grant with S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> that the Pope as Pope hath no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall iuriſdiction, his power, as he is Pope, being onely ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall. If then it be ſo, that the Pope as Pope hath no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall power ouer Princes, nor can depoſe them, <hi>etiam iuſta de cauſa,</hi> as the Cardinall ſaith, ſurely I cannot with criſtall ſpectacles ſee how he can depoſe as a ſpiritual Prince, there being no perceptible difference betweene them.</p>
            <p>If I ſhould ſtand to note vnto you the reſt of his obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ambiguities, I feare I ſhould be too tedious, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I purpoſe to ſurceaſſe, and leaue them to your prudent conſideration: as, The Pope hath not any power meerely temporall; he cannot as Pope ordinarily depoſe temporall Princes, as an ordinarie iudge; he hath at leaſt indirectly a certaine power, and that chiefeſt or higheſt in temporals: and ſuch like, which ſeeme no leſſe fearfully then obſcurely written and taught.</p>
            <p>This doubtful doctrine of moſt learned Cardinal <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> and the varietie or contrarietie of opinions betweene him and other very learned Clerkes in Gods church about this matter of depoſition, is to me a moſt ſtrong argument,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20220:18"/>that it is not <hi>de fide:</hi> for if it were, then would there be an vniforme content and perfect agreement among them, not onely of the thing controuerted, but alſo of the manner, and cauſes thereof, no leſſe then is of Purgatorie, prayer to Saints, of the reall preſence of Chriſts bodie and bloud in the B. Sacrament, of the virginitie of our B. Ladie, incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, ſeuen Sacraments, and ſo of all other points of faith. Then would a matter of ſuch moment haue bene found in the writings of ſome ancient Father, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of leſſe importance; but for wel neare a thouſand yeares continuance, till the time of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 7. it was neuer chalenged, mentioned or defended by any writer: or elſe it would haue bene defined in ſome generall Councell, whoſe authoritie bindeth all Chriſtians to beleeue whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is there decreed, to be <hi>de fide,</hi> without controuerſie; which to this day neuer was, no not in the third Councell of Lateran vnder <hi>Innocentius</hi> 3. as ſome ignorantly thinke, and build them ſtrong caſtles in the aire; and others incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately auerre, howbeit not ſimply and plainly, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what timorouſly, which they need not do if it were ſo, but ſhould confidently auouch it ſo to be.<note place="margin">Prou. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Qui ambulat ſimplicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ambulat confidenter.</hi> He that goeth ſimply and plainly to worke, goeth confidently. A matter of faith is to be taught ſincerely and perſpicuouſly, not doubtfully or guilefully, as it were to deceiue his readers, or thereby to hold them in ſuſpence in ſuch wiſe, as they ſhall euer remaine perplexed and to ſeeke of the one meaning of what is written.</p>
            <p>O ſir, if you reade that Councell of Lateran, cap. 3. you ſhall finde it plainly decreed, that Princes which be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in purging out of their territories the filth of hereſie, are to be depoſed.</p>
            <p>This indeed were ſomewhat to the purpoſe, if it were true as you ſay; but if you beleeue ſo, you are in an errour: for who readeth that chapter, ſhall well perceiue it was not there decreed or defined, but treated of the manner how certaine ſecular powers or temporall Lords (without ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying Kings) might be proceeded withall; and nothing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20220:18"/>decreed <hi>de fide</hi> concerning depoſition of Princes: if it had bene defined matter of faith, it muſt of neceſſity haue bound all Catholickes, as well Princes as people, to beleeue it, and accept thereof. Moreouer, ſuch a decree muſt alwayes haue continued immutable, and could not be abrogated, as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> writeth: <hi>Decreta de fide immutabilia ſunt,</hi>

And is any man ſo vnwiſe to thinke, that Princes will euer receiue ſuch decrees as may bereaue them of their ſcepters and temporall ſtates, and turne to their vtter ruine?

            <p>Furthermore, in that chapter is no mention made of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating Emperour or Kings, nor depoſing them, nor abſoluing their ſubiects from their naturall obedience, but of excommunicating hereſie, giuing ouer ſuch as are condemned for that crimce, to the ſecular magiſtrate to be puniſhed; and ordering withall, that certaine other ſecular powers or principall Lords inferiour to Kings, as may be Poteſtates, Conſuls, Rectors, or ſuch like (which by the conſtitution of Fredericke 2.<note place="margin">pag. 66</note> Emperour is euident) ſhould be compelled (if neede were) to take an oath to do their endeuour for the extirpation of heretickes out of ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

And, if the Pope hath not power in earth, to diſpoſe of temporals, euen to the depoſition of thoſe Princes, who are either the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues heretikes, or in any ſort do fauour heretikes; why at the edition of this Canon, did none of ſo great a number, reclame againſt it? Why durſt not, no not one, among ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Embaſſadors of Emperours and kings, once mutter at it?</p>
            <p>This lo, is all the Cardinall bringeth for proofe of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed decree of faith, in the third Councell of Lateran, (which is little to the purpoſe, and not ſo dreadfull as the words import, if it be well conſidered) ſaying: It is the voice of the Catholicke Church. What? that it is a point of faith there concluded, binding all Chriſtians to beleeue, that the Pope hath power to depoſe kings, and diſpoſe of temporals? Was there <hi>Anathema</hi> thundred againſt any that ſhould not beleeue it? Nothing leſſe, as you may ſee if ye note the words. And therefore <hi>Barclai</hi> hath not conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned the Church (nor others that agree with him in opinion) who did alway highly reuerence whatſoeuer ſhe decreed, <hi>tanquam de fide,</hi> in any general Councell; whoſe ſoule I truſt doth reſt in peace, and whoſe defence I make no doubt but ſome will take in hand.</p>
            <p>Then his Grace demandeth, why none reclamed againſt this Canon, nor any Embaſſadour once muttered at it? This why, in my judgement, may be anſwered with a, Wherfore haue Metropolitans and Biſhops all this time, being almoſt 400. yeares agone, bin ſo negligent in performing their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,<note place="margin">The 3 Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran held an. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And wherefore haue not Biſhops that were remiſſe and negligent in purging hereſie out of their Dioceſſes, bene depoſed according to the Councels order, as appeareth in the end of this Canon? The words are, <hi>Volumus igitur &amp; mandamus, &amp; in virtute obedientiae diſtricte
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20220:20"/>praecipimus, &amp;c.</hi> We will therefore and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, &amp; in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of obedience do ſtraightly charge, that for the effectuall execution of theſe things, Biſhops watch diligently ouer thei Dioceſſes, as they will auoide the Canonicall reuenge. For if any Biſhop ſhall be negligent or remiſſe in purging out of his dioceſſe the leauen of hereticall deformitie, when that ſhall appeare by euident ſignes, let him be depoſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Epiſcopall office, and into his roome let another that is fit be ſubſtituted, who will, and is able to confound hereticall prauitie. This out of the Councell. Are theſe to be reputed as Heathens and publicans for not obeying the voice of the Church in this point? I know the Cardinall will not be ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere a iudge, in ſuch wiſe to cenſure them, albeit they obey not the ſtraight commandement of this great and famous<note place="margin">Conc. Trid. Seſſ 25. c. 22. &amp; de reform. cap. 20.</note> Councell, whoſe decrees of reformation, as alſo of all other general Councels, they are more bound to accept and put in execution, then kings and ſecular potentates.</p>
            <p>And is it not more then probable that ſome there recla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſome muttered, though the Cardinall haply find it not regiſtred, when according to the order of the Councell, and by vertue of this decree it was neuer executed? Then, <hi>Nonne fruſtra eſt illa potentia quae nunquam redigitur in actum?</hi> Yes ſaith Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> ſpeaking in a like caſe, of Chriſts regall power in earth, vpon thoſe words of our Sauiour:<note place="margin">Ioan. 18.</note>

Conc. can. 50 &amp; 59.</note> the Monkes and religious of Italie, France, and other countries can teſtifie. In the ſixth generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, clergie men were forbidden to play at dice; and it was ordered that Baptiſme ſhould be adminiſtred onely in Churches: which are not kept. Many mo inſtances out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Councels might be to this purpoſe produced, but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide tediouſneſſe theſe few may ſuffiſe.</p>
            <p>Now for a further anſwer, I wiſh you to note, that this Councell indeed (as by the words in the chapter is cleare) did firſt excommunicate all hereſie that lifted vp it ſelfe againſt that faith which the Fathers had ſet down in the two precedent chapters: and ordained that ſuch as were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore condemned, as alſo all other heretickes, ſhould be left vnto the ſecular powers to be condignly puniſhed. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this holy Synode decreed, that ſuch as were onely ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of hereſie ſhould cleare themſelues of that note within a yeare after admonition; otherwiſe they were to be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated and auoyded till they had made condigne ſatif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Which was but the right practiſe and true procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Church, to inflict ſpirituall cenſures, that the ſoules of the offendors might be ſaued in the day of our Lord, leauing them to the ſecular Magiſtrates to be further puniſhed temporally.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it was ſet downe in this Synode, as meete and conuenient, that ſecular powers ſhould be admoniſhed, and if need were, compelled to take a publike oath for defence of faith, and to do their beſt endeuours to roote out of their territories, all ſuch heretikes as ſhould be denounced by the Church: &amp; none to be aſſumed into office which ſhould not by oath confirme this chapter. By ſecular powers and ſuch as ſhall be aſſumed into poteſtacie or office, either ſpirituall
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:20220:21"/>or temporal, was not nor could be meant Emperor or King, but rather Preſidents or Gouerners of Prouinces ſubiect vnto Kings, and abſolute Princes; who being Catholickes, may by their excelling power aſſiſting the Church, compell them to confirme this chapter by taking ſuch an Oath: but themſelues cannot be compelled by any, hauing no ſuperior on earth in temporals to force them thereunto. Neither may it be ſaid properly, that a King, coming to his crowne by lawfull ſucceſſion and inheritance, or election, is aſſumed into office by any, his ſubiects or others; for then it would follow, that he were not <hi>ſupremus Dominus,</hi> a Soueraigne, but in ſome ſort inferiour to thoſe that do aſſume him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he that is aſſumed or taken into office, receiueth au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie from him that aſſumeth. As, the Pope creating a Cardinall, and ſaying, <hi>Aſſumimus te inſanctae Romanae Eccleſiae Cardinalem,</hi> We aſſume thee to be a Cardinall of the holy Romane Church, giueth him by his ſupreme authoritie that ſpirituall office and dignitie of aſſiſting him in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, and his temporall ſtate, and to haue <hi>vocem actiuam &amp; paſſiuam</hi> in the election of the Pope, &amp;c. But his Holineſſe, though elected by the Cardinals, cannot properly be ſaid to be aſſumed by them to the Popedome, becauſe he receiueth no power or authoritie from them, but immediatly from God.</p>
            <p>Finally, to the latter part, <hi>Si vero dominus temporalis:</hi> on which Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> fortifieth his aſſertion of the Popes authoritie to depoſe Princes, ſaying, It is the voice of the Church: it may be anſwered, that the Church here defined it not, as he well knoweth; if ſhe had, no doubt but his Grace would haue ſpoken it plainly, to put all out of doubt. By temporall Lords in this place, ought not to be vnderſtood Kings, but rather ſuch as are explicated in the Emperours conſtitution, to wit, Poteſtates, Conſuls, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, is hereafter followeth pag. 34. or ſuch feudatarie Princes as haue principall Lords ouer them, like to certaine in Italy, where this Councell was held: which is manifeſt by this Canon, that reſerueth the right of the principall
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20220:22"/>Lord, <hi>Saluo iure Domini principalis.</hi> But I know ſome will ſay, that Kings and abſolute Princes are to be alſo included, for that the words in the latter end ſeem to import ſo much, <hi>The ſame law being kept about thoſe who haue not principall Lords:</hi> which ought to be vnderſtood of abſolute Princes. <hi>Lord,</hi> being a generall word, ſignifying ſometime Kings. May it not be admired, that out of this obſcuritie of the law, men will enforce Kings to be vnderſtood, and to be ſubiect to temporall puniſhments, who acknowledge no ſuperiour on earth to puniſh them in temporals, eſpecially when as no mention is made of them at all in the law? In pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals (as I haue ſaid before pag. 51.) a reſtriction is to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, not an ampliation; and Kings are no leſſe to be named or ſpecified by the orderly proceeding of the Church, then Cardinals,<note place="margin">Conc. Trid. ſeſſ. 24. de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. cap. 1.</note> who are alwayes named in <hi>poenis,</hi> or elſe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, though the Pope command <hi>ſub poena excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis</hi> all Patriarchs, Archbiſhops or Biſhops, of what digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſoeuer. If yet any will enforce, that <hi>By thoſe who haue not principall Lords,</hi> Kings are or may be vnderſtood, it helpeth them nothing at all, for that ſuch a law, firſt neuer receiued, and againe <hi>per deſuetudinem,</hi> being neuer by the Church put in practiſe, is abrogated and of no validitie.</p>
            <p>Neither was it defined in this Councell (as all men of meane iudgement may ſee) that the Pope hath authoritie to abſolue ſubiects from their loyaltie or naturall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence due to their Princes; but onely ſignified, that he might denounce the vaſſals of certaine temporall Lords, abſolued (as it were by vertue of ſome former law, to wit, that of <hi>Gregorie</hi> 7, <hi>Nos ſanctorum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">15. q. 6. ca: Nos ſanctoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> or ſome other) from their fealtie, who being admoniſhed and excommunicated by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitane, ſhall contemne to make ſatisfaction within a yeare: which is not to abſolue them by any authoritie giuen by this Councell, and ſo it maketh nothing againſt the Oath of allegiance: <hi>That the Pope cannot abſolue me from this Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then laſtly it followeth: <hi>And may expoſe his land to be occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by Catholickes.</hi> Is not this (trow ye) the groundworke of the Cardinals bulwarke for the Apoſtolicall authoritie
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20220:22"/>of depoſing Princes, and diſpoſing of their temporals? It ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth yes, in his anſwer to D. <hi>Barclai;</hi> howbeit his Grace bringeth nothing to proue ſuch power to be in the Pope,<note place="margin">Supra pag. 54</note> but onely ſaith that, you wote not what, is the <hi>voice of the Catholicke Church, and he that contemneth to heare her, is no way to be accounted a Chriſtian, but as a heathen and Publican.</hi> What words here in the name of God import a definition? The Councell, as you may ſee, vſeth none of theſe words to make a decree <hi>de fide, ordinamus, ſtatuimus, definimus,</hi> we or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, decree, define the Pope to haue authoritie to depoſe, nor <hi>anathema qui hoc non credit, anathema</hi> to him that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not this, nor yet, <hi>Haec eſt fides Catholica,</hi> This is the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke faith: but onely ſaith, That if the temporall Lord admoniſhed by the Church, ſhal neglect to purge his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey from hereſie, he is to be excommunicated by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan; and if he contemne to make ſatisfaction within a yeare, it is to be ſignified to the Pope, that he may expoſe his land (which is not to depoſe <hi>authoritatiuè</hi>) to be occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by Catholickes, <hi>crucem praedicando,</hi> that is, to giue indulgences or pardons to ſuch as ſhall voluntarily take armes, and aduenture their liues to fight againſt heretickes; and as he is accuſtomed in like ſort to grant to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that ſhall arme themſelues and labour to expell the Turks or Saracens out of the countries they vſurpe vpon, or the holy land: as will appeare plainly to him that readeth this Canon of the Councell. For, it followeth immediatly: <hi>Catholici vero, qui crucis aſſumpto charactere ad haereticorum exterminium ſe accinxerint, illa gaudeant indulgentia, illo<expan>
                     <am>

Hereby euery man may ſee, that in this wiſe to expoſe a country by ſuch priuiledges and pardons to Prince or people, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon zeale of dying Martyrs, as they thinke, or rather
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20220:23"/>couetous deſire to enlarge their dominions, and to enrich themſelues with others ſpoiles, are ready to take ſuch an occaſion, and to runne before they be ſent; is nothing to this purpoſe, for depoſing a lawfull Prince by any authority giuen the Pope by our Sauiour Chriſt in S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or by the holy Ghoſt in a generall Councell. You will ſay vnto me, Are not heretickes being obſtinate, vpon contempt of the Churches ſword of excommunication, to be puniſhed tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally by depriuation and confiſcation of their goods, yea and by death too?

            <p>In Engliſh thus: We decree alſo by this edict, for euer to be of force, that Poteſtates, and Conſuls, or Rectors, what offices ſoeuer they beare, for defence of faith, take a publike oath, that they ſhall ſeriouſly endeuour what in them lieth, to roote out all heretikes noted by the Church, out of the countries ſubiect to their gouernment, ſo that from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth, whenſoeuer any ſhall be aſſumpted to a Poteſtacie for euer, or for a time, let him be bound to confirme this chapter by oath, otherwiſe let them not be eſteemed for Poteſtates, or for Conſuls, or ſuch like: and their ſentences we decree forthwith to be vnprofitable and of no force. And if the temporall Lord, required and admoniſhed by the Church, ſhall neglect to purge his countrie from hereticall prauitie, after a yeare expired from the time of the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we expoſe his countrie to be occupied by Catholikes: who, when the heretikes are rooted out, may poſſeſſe it without any contradiction, and maintaine it in the puritie
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:20220:24"/>of faith: the right of the principall Lord being reſerued: ſo that vpon this he bring no obſtacle, nor procure any impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment: the ſame law notwithſtanding being obſerued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them that haue not principall Lords, &amp;c.

            <p>Now can any man perceiue by this imperiall law (procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and vſed by the Church in the puniſhment of heretikes) that kings are bound to take the oath therein ſpecified? or that it is meant, their countries ſhould be giuen from them, if after the Churches admonition they yet remaine negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in extirpating heretikes? Nothing leſſe. Firſt, becauſe kings are not named or mentioned, which is requiſite; but Poteſtates (as are in Italie) Conſuls, and Rectors, or Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of prouinces, ſuch as are inferiors, or ſubiect to the Emperour or kings; therefore they are not compriſed in the law. Nor ſecondly, can they be compriſed therein (though perchance you will ſay, that by the latter clauſe, it is meant alſo by kings, and all other abſolute Princes, who haue no dependance of the Emperour) for that they are not bound to the keeping of the law being penall.<note place="margin">L.

            <p>Thirdly, the Emperor being no ſuperior to abſolute kings, cannot conſtraine them by any law ciuill, nor puniſh them.<note place="margin">L. non magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus D. de recep.

            <p>But ſuppoſing that chapter of the Councell, whereof we ſpake before, or rather of <hi>Innocentius</hi> in the Councell, were a decree, what then? doth it follow infallibly that it is. <hi>de fide?</hi> No. The moſt reuerend Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will tell you,<note place="margin">Bella l. 2. Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cap. 12.</note> that in Councels the greateſt part of the acts appertaine not to faith, as diſputations, reaſons, explications, &amp;c. <hi>Sed tantum ipſa nuda decreta, &amp; ea non omnia, ſed tantùm quae pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponuntur tanquam de fide.</hi> That is, But onely the verie bare decrees, and not all thoſe neither, but onely ſuch as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as of faith. For ſometime (ſaith he) Councels do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine ſomewhat, not as certaine, but as probable, as the Councell of Vienna, which decreed to be holden as the more probable, that grace and vertues are infuſed to infants in Baptiſme, as is, <hi>Clement. vnica de ſumma Trinit. &amp; fide Cath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why then Sir, how ſhal I know when a decree is of faith, and when it is not? Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the place aboue noted will put you out of doubt thereof. <hi>Quando autem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretum proponatur tanquam de ſide, facilè cognoſcitur ex verbis Concilij; ſemper enim dicere ſolent, ſe explicare fidem Catholicam vel haereticos habendos qui contrariu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſentiunt, &amp;c.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a decree is propoſed as of faith, it is eaſily knowne by the words of the Councel; for they are alway accuſtomed to ſay, that they explicate the Catholike faith, or, they are to be held for he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes that think the contrarie; or which is moſt vſuall, they ſay Anathema, and exclude out of the Church, thoſe that are of contrary opinion. And when they haue none of theſe, it is not certaine that the matter is of faith. This he. By which you learne, &amp; may ſecure your conſcience, that the doctrine of depoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Princes, either directly or indirectly, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, or extraordinarily, caſually or by conſequence, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in ſuch ſort decreed in the Councell of Lateran, or any other Councell to this day: nor euer defined by any Pope

               <hi>ex cathedra</hi> (as ſome take it) in Conſiſtorie <hi>tanquam res fidei formaliter,</hi> as a matter of faith formally.</p>
            <p>If yet further you deſire to know what Authors write, that the Popes authoritie in things temporall (as depoſing Princes, and diſpoſing kingdomes you take to be) was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer defined; you may reade Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> againſt the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Iuſtice, c. 4. f. 326. who ſaith,<note place="margin">Alanus.</note> that it is a meere matter of Diuinitie diſputable in ſchoole, and no certaintie as yet defined by the Church, touching the Popes authoritie in things temporall. The ſame affirme <hi>Couarruuias,</hi>

            <p>Here it may be you will obiect vnto me, and ſay, that <hi>Paulus</hi> 5. in prohibiting by his Breues the Oath of allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſeemeth there to define <hi>ex cathedra</hi> the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in temporals, as ſome of our Paſtors ſince this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie teach vs; I pray you let me know your opinion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be definitiue ſentences or no.</p>
            <p>Beloued brethren, aſſure your ſelues they deceiue you, that ſo ignorantly inſtruct you; and while they leade you into an errour, they hazard your ouerthrow. Thoſe Breues are no definitions, but rather admonitions or aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as the firſt, dated 10. <hi>Kalendas Octobris,</hi> 1606. which hath: <hi>Propterea admonemus vos, vt ab hoc at que ſimilibus iura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis praeſtandis omnino caueatis, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore we admoniſh you to beware of taking this and the like Oaths; affirming it withall to be vnlawfull. Or elſe precepts, (though not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie <hi>ad mortale peccatum</hi>) as the ſecond ſeemed to be, dated 10. <hi>Kalend. Septembris,</hi> 1607. prohibiting the taking thereof. All which make not a definition <hi>ex cathedra;</hi> and it may wel be preſumed, that his Holineſſe neuer had any ſuch intention to ſet forth ſuch a decree. To know when a decree is <hi>de fide,</hi> you may learne by that I told you a little before out of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> whoſe rule is well to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. If theſe Breues were definitions <hi>de fide ex cathedra</hi> (as ſome moſt fondly and ignorantly ſticke not to auouch) ſome of thoſe clauſes and interminations mentioned by Cardinal
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20220:26"/>
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had bene inſerted; they muſt haue bene generall, and ought to bind all Chriſtian people as well as Engliſh Catholickes: for what is faith in one countrey, ought to be ſuch through the world, and to be agreed vpon among learned men without controuerſie. But theſe, being dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to one particular nation, and for this one particular cauſe of the Oath of allegiance, can be no decree <hi>ex cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra,</hi> but rather priuate exhortatory letters, no precepts, as a late writer affirmeth them to be:<note place="margin">Andraeas Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemon ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis Ieſ. in praefat. ad Tortur Torti.</note>

Which may be of little force, and not bind, ſpecially if they were procured by ſiniſter meanes, as by ſurreption, wrong information, and ſo forth, as with great reaſon it may be preſumed theſe were, by a perſon more turbulent then was fitting for one of his function and vocation, whoſe merit haply might haue bene greater by deuout ſaying one paire of beades, then was by his labours and trauailes with his Holineſſe to kindle quenched coales, as moſt probably he did in playing the ſoliciter, and procuring thoſe Breues; whereby he hath brought all in brandlement, ſet no ſmall contention and diuiſion among brethren and friends, and raiſed a tempeſtuous ſea of calamities and troubles, where a happie calme of peace and quietneſſe was not vnlike to be: for which God pardon his ſoule.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, ſome good Authors not only doubt whether the Pope alone may determine or define matters of faith, but plainely ſeeme to ſay, ſuch a determination doth not bind; and ſo he cannot without a generall Council. <hi>Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatio ſolius Papae</hi> (ſaith <hi>Gerſon</hi>) <hi>in his quae ſunt fidei,</hi>

Now let your learned inſtructors peruſe and conſider well the foreſaid Authors (Catholicke) and the Gloſſe, with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation thereof, alſo Catholicke; and then I perſwade my ſelfe, they wil with more aduiſement giue you better inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and confeſſe that thoſe Breues are farre from defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſentences; if not, I wiſh for your good, you may light on better, and better experienced, leſt the blind leading the blind, both fall into the pit: <hi>Si enim coecus coecum ducit, ambo in foueam cadent.</hi>

            <p>Well, grant they are no definitions, yet it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but that therein his Holineſſe hath declared, many things to be contained in the Oath againſt faith, and the health of ſoules, and thereupon prohibited all Catholickes to take the ſame; whoſe commandement (if any other) is to be obeyed, by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine: <hi>Obedite Praepoſitis veſtris, &amp; ſubiacete eis:</hi>

If any man be ſcandalized, and pleaſe to carpe hereat as at ſtrange doctrine, let him reade the famous and learned <hi>S. Tho. More</hi> in his Epiſtle to D. <hi>Wilſon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tho. More in his epiſt. to D. Wilſ. p. 1445.</note> where he ſhall ſee the very ſame taught in this manner. Many things (euerie man learned woteth well) there are, in which euery man is at libertie, without perill of damnation, to thinke which way he liſt, till the one part be determined for neceſſarie to be belieued by a generall Councell. And in another place of his workes,<note place="margin">In epiſt. ad fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, pa. 1439.</note> thus he writeth: If it ſo hap, that in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular part of Chriſtendome, there be a law made, that be ſuch, as for ſome part thereof ſome men thinke that the law of God cannot beare it, and ſome other thinke yes; the thing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20220:27"/>being in ſuch manner in queſtion, that through diuers parts of Chriſtendome, ſome that are good men and cunning, both of our owne dayes and before our dayes, thinke ſome one way; and ſome other of like learning and goodneſſe, thinke the contrary. In this caſe he that thinketh againſt the law, neither may ſweare that law lawfully was made, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his own conſcience to the contrary; nor is bound vpon Gods diſplcaſure to change his own conſcience therein, for any particular law made any where, other then by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell, and by a generall faith growne by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of God vniuerſally through all Chriſtian nations: nor other authoritie then one of theſe twaine (except ſpeciall reuelation, and expreſſe commandement of God:) ſith the contrary opinions of good men and well learned, as I put you the caſe, made the vnderſtanding of the Scriptures doubtfull, I can ſee none that lawfully may command and compell any man to change his own opinion, &amp; tranſlate his owne conſcience from the one ſide to the other. This he. And in another Epiſtle to his daughter <hi>Margaret,</hi> pag. 1440 If it be not ſo fully plaine and euident (as appearing by the common faith of Chriſtendome) yet if he ſee but himſelfe with farre the fewer part thinke the one way, againſt far the more part of as learned and as good as thoſe are that affirme the thing that he thinketh, thinking and affirming the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, and that of ſuch folke as he hath no reaſonable cauſe, wherefore he ſhould not in that matter ſuppoſe, that thoſe which ſay they thinke againſt his mind, affirme the thing that they ſay, for none other cauſe, but for that they ſo think indeed: this is of very truth, a very good occaſion to moue him, and yet not to compell him to conforme his mind and conſcience vnto theirs. By this doctrine of Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> it is cleare, that the Popes opinion of the Oath, though it may ſeeme to ſome, to be a verie good occaſion to moue men not to take it, yet it is not ſufficient to compell them to conforme their mind and conſcience vnto his; when as they that haue taken it, and alſo many others both vertuous and learned, are of contrarie opinion, nothing to be contained
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20220:28"/>in that Oath againſt or repugnant to faith; nor neuer hath this point in controuerſie bene yet defined.</p>
            <p>Will you ſay then that the Pope hath erred in ſetting forth this his opinion and prohibition? No, I dare not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to affirme that therein he hath erred, for the reuerence and honor I beare to the Sea Apoſtolick, nor take vpon me to be iudge ouer him, <hi>Qui parem ſuper terram non habet,</hi> to vſe Saint <hi>Bernards</hi> words;<note place="margin">L. 2. de conſid c. 2. Rom. 14.</note> leſt I be thought to neglect the doctrine of the holy Ghoſt taught by S. <hi>Paul: Tu quis es qui iudicas alienum ſeruum?</hi> and, <hi>Tu autem quid iudicas fratrem tuum? aut tu quare ſperuis fratrem tuum?</hi> Who art thou that iudgeſt anothers ſeruant? and why doeſt thou iudge thy brother? If I be taught and forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tp iudge or deſpiſe my brother, my equall; then much more ought I not to iudge or contemne him, <hi>qui à nemine iudicatur,</hi> that is not to be iudged by any man: <hi>abſit hoc à me,</hi> let ſuch temeritie be farre from me, the leaſt in Gods houſe. But when in matters of fact, he proceedeth by information of others, (as in this our caſe of the Oath he hath) I truſt it is no temeritie, or any ſin at all, to ſay that he may erre; yea and ſometimes by falſe ſuggeſtions or wrong informations, he hath erred in Rome it ſelfe. And which is more, Councels alſo in facts, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular iudgements may erre, as Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> noteth. <hi>In Scriptura</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>nullus poteſt eſſe error,</hi>

            <p>It ſeemeth alſo not to be any hereticall doctrine to hold, that not onely in matters of fact, but likewiſe in faith the Pope alone without a Councell may erre, for that he is no God, but a man ſubiect to errors; to whom as he is <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, Chriſt neuer ſo promiſed the aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, that he in perſon ſhould not erre, but to <hi>Peter</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>The cauſe why the Pope prohibited Catholickes to take the Oath of allegiance as it lieth, may ſeeme to haue bene, for that in his opinion he was perſwaded many things to be contained therein repugnant to faith.

For his priuate will, ſubiect to error, can be no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible rule of mans actions, but the will of God, which is alway right: and hereupon a man may in caſe be diſobeied, be he Prince or Prelate, but the moſt righteous God neuer.

            <p>When <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> otherwiſe a prudent Prince and learned Paſtor, commanded a boy of fourteene yeares of age to be hanged in Rome, for a fault which in many mens iudgements deſerued not death, but rather whipping, or ſome ſuch puniſhment; and being in all humility told by the Iudge, that by the ciuill lawes he was not to be executed till he came to the age of 16: he anſwered, Then I will giue him two of my yeares. Whereupon the poore lad, contrarie to law, ended his life in port haſt in a halter. Whether this were a iuſt ſentence or iniuſt, I will not ſay; it ſeemed at his departure out of this life, to be ſcored among his miſdeeds: for being in <hi>extremis,</hi> one like in habit to <hi>S.

Yes; and now it is in maner expired (he had then reigned fiue yeares, foure moneths, and three daies); for if you remember, you gaue a boy two yeares, to hang him. This I heard conſtantly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by manie in Rome preſently vpon his death. But who this was that appeared, <hi>S. Francis,</hi> or ſome other transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his habite, it was not knowne, and I leaue to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of men to thinke what they liſt.</p>
            <p>Likewise it happened, that in his time a Clergie man, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew vnto old <hi>Martinus Nauarrus</hi> the great Canoniſt, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into <hi>S.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20220:30"/>and brake his head ſo, as the bloud ran about his eares, and fell on the pauement; whereby the Church being profaned, forthwith all Maſſes and other diuine ſeruice ceaſſed for a time, (I ſpeake what I know, being then <hi>oculatus teſtis:</hi>) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently the partie fled toward the new Church, but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by certaine Suitzers attending on the ſaid Iudge, was apprehended; and the Pope then ſitting in Conſiſtorie, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed of the fact, who commanded a ghoſtly father to be prouided for him, (religiouſly and well done for ſafetie of his ſoule) and that he ſhould not hope for life, but prepare to die out of hand, <hi>(ſummum ius)</hi> for he would not dine till the offender were hanged.

Incontinently a gallowes was ſet vp before the Suitzers gate, and the Spaniſh gentleman brought to execution within three houres after the blow giuen, the Pope ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in a gallerie of his pallace (Conſiſtorie being ended) to ſee him coming, as was moſt certainly reported vnto me then lying in the pallace, by ſuch as had reaſon to know it: and would not be pacified or intreated for his life, neither by the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour, who poſted to the Court to that end, though in vaine, for audience would not be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor by any other; howbeit his ſeruant the Suitzer, in ſhort ſpace after recouered, and liued diuers yeares after that to my knowledge.

            <p>Moreouer, the ſaid Pope hauing created Cardinall the Deane of Toledo, <hi>Mendoza</hi> by name, a verie noble and worthie gentleman, a comely and courteous Prelate, and well beloued of many; dealt often with the ſaid Cardinall
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20220:31"/>to reſigne his Deanrie into his hands, by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie he ſhould be driuen into, if at any time after, he were to reſide in his Deanrie according to order, by taking inferior place in the Church to the Biſhop of the Dioceſſe, being no Cardinall; which was a thing he would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto, ſaying, they were <hi>incompatibilia,</hi> Deane and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall in one perſon. The Cardinall vnwilling to loſe ſo great reuenewes by making ſuch a reſignation, thought it no ſinne therein not to yeeld to his Holineſſe. Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> notwithſtanding out of his abſolute authoritie <hi>volens nolens</hi> depriued him of his Deanry, &amp; beſtowed it on another Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, who after <hi>Sixtus</hi> death, plaied leaſt in ſight, for feare what might befall him by ſome of the Cardinall his friends for accepting or ſeeking it.

Many hereat muttered and murmured, iudging the commandement to ſauour of great iniuſtice.</p>
            <p>After this, Pope <hi>Clement</hi> in the beginning of his reigne, with more haſte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good ſpeed, reſembling likewiſe rather a paſſionate Prince then a meek Paſtor, gaue order or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement that a certain gentleman of Cardinall <hi>Farne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> apprehended on Saturday before Palmſunday, ſhould be executed the wedneſday following, being the feaſt of the Annunciation of the bleſſed virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> and in the holy weeke, againſt all clement Chriſtian cuſtomes and good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which ſpare to execute any malefactor on ſuch times: &amp; would not hearken to any other information then that of the Gouernour, the gentlemans knowne aduerſarie, no not

The ſayd gentleman ſeing this ſtir, came to them, and demanded how they durſt be ſo bold to make ſuch an attempt in that place, and whether they knew where they were, and in whoſe houſe, which (being priuiledged as a ſanctuarie) ought better to be reſpected of ſuch as they were, and ſuch like words.

            <p>Well, if for relating theſe truths any man be offended, let him blame certaine ſilie ſoules whoſe fond importunitie hath vrged me thereto, for that they thinke, and will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20220:32"/>ſay, that the Pope his actions are irreprehenſible, he cannot commit a mortall ſinne, nor command vniuſtly; as if he were more then a mortall man, halfe a God, or ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in grace that he could no way erre, as was the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God. But the more prudent ſort will eaſily grant that he is a man, ſubiect to humane infirmities, and not ſo confirmed in grace as that he cannot erre in his morall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that is a priuiledge they know rather proper to the Mother of God, then common to Chriſts Vicars, which (if I be not deceiued) was neuer yet granted to any of them. Marie ſome of theſe, <hi>prudentes apud ſemetipſos,</hi> dare boldlie auouch, that if <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſour ſhal at any time excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate a Prince fallen into ſchiſme, hereſie or apoſtacie, or other crime adiudged by him to deſerue ſo to be cenſured, and thereupon depriueth him of his Regall ſcepter, depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him of all temporall dominion, and diſpoſeth of his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories to ſome other whom he ſhall iudge better to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the ſame; or authoriſeth ſubiects to raiſe tumults and take armes againſt ſuch a one, and abſolueth them of their fidelitie and natural allegiance, or inciteth other neighbour Kings and Princes by mightie power, to inuade his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, or finallie whatſoeuer he command in this or the like ſort, they are bound forthwith to obey him and his ſentence, what perill ſoeuer may fall vnto them for it; though by ſo doing they are to loſe their liues who (as they imprudently thinke) hath in ſuch a caſe ſo ſupreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ouer him as exceedeth all limits, &amp; is ſo directed by the holy Ghoſt that he cannot command iniuſtly: ſo <hi>omne ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium vertitur in vitium,</hi> this loe is the prudence of ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent Catholickes, who headlonglie without due conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration runne on themſelues, and animate others to run through ouer blind obedience to their vtter deſtruction; but this point of obedience reſteth now to be more largely diſcuſſed.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied but that obedience is a morall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue (whereas it is a part of iuſtice, whoſe office is to render to euery one that which is his:) the ſpeciall obiect of which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20220:32"/>is the ſecret or expreſſe precept of the ſuperiour, to whom e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery inferiour, both by the law and ordinance of God and nature, ought in all things lawfull, not to be refractarie, but ſubiect &amp; obedient. Yet it may ſo happen againe, that for two reſpects a ſubiect or inferiour may not be bound al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to obey his ſuperiour: the one is by reaſon of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a higher power commanding contrary, as vpon that of <hi>S. Paul, Qui poteſtati reſiſtunt, ipſi ſibi damnationem acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> They that reſiſt power, the ſame get to themſelues damnation. The Gloſſe ſaith, <hi>Si quid iuſſerit Curator, &amp;c.</hi>

Againe if the Proconſul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee one thing, and the Emperour an other thing, is it to be doubted that contemning the one, thou art to ſerue and obey the other? Then if the Emperour one thing, and God command an other, thou art bound to obey God and not the Emperour. So ſemblably if the Pope command one thing, and the holy Ghoſt in Scriptures an other, who doubteth which is to be obeyed or diſobeyed? The other is, when the ſuperiour commandeth any thing wherein the inferiour is not ſubiect vnto him, exceeding the limits of his power: all power whatſoeuer vnder the cope of heauen being contained within certaine limits, which no power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perſon is to exceede.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20220:33"/>ſhould, the inferiour is not bound to obey. No more can the Pope, albeit he hath <hi>plenit udinem poteſtatis in Eccleſia,</hi> iuſtly command any thing wherein he hath no power, nor any perſons which are not ſubiect vnto him: for that none is to be reputed a ſuperior,<note place="margin">Tho. 2.2. q. 67. ar. 1.</note> but in reſpect of them, ouer whom as ouer ſubiects he receiueth power, whether he hath it ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, or by commiſſion. Neither are Religious men, who vow obedience to their ſuperious, bound of neceſſity to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them in all whatſoeuer lawfull things they command, (albeit in way of perfection they may) but onely in ſuch as appertaine to their regular conuerſation, or according to their rule which they profeſſe.<note place="margin">Tolet de 7. pec. mort. c. 16. n. 3.

            <p>If it muſt be granted that Chriſtians by the law of God are ſtrictly bound to obey all iuſt determinatiue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and decrees that proceed from the Sea Apoſtolicke, being the higheſt ſpirituall tribunall in Gods Church; why muſt it not likewiſe be granted that ſubiects, as wel Clercks as laicks, are by the ſame law no leſſe bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>in foro co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcientiae</hi> to be obedient to the King and his iuſt lawes, the chiefeſt tribunall in the common wealth?

            <p>I confeſſe (you will ſay) that humane iuſt lawes haue their efficacie of binding all ſubiects to obey in the Court of conſcience,<note place="margin">Tho. 1.2. q. 96. ar. 4.</note> from the eternall law of God, of which they are deriued, according to that of <hi>Salomon: Per me Reges regnant,</hi>

But whether this law of the Oath (which you aime at) be ſuch, ſome make doubt; for that Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in <hi>Tortus,</hi> and father <hi>Parſons</hi> in his Catholicke letter affirme, many things to be contained therein againſt the ſpirituall primacie of the chiefe Paſtor, and his authoritie of binding and looſing: and concerning the limitation (to vſe father <hi>Parſons</hi> owne words) of his Holineſſe authoritie, to wit, what he cannot do towards his Maieſtie, or his ſucceſſors in anie caſe whatſoeuer. Moreouer, beſides pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ciuill and temporall obedience in the Oath, other things are interlaced and mixt therewith, which do detract from the ſpirituall authoritie of the higheſt Paſtor, at leaſt wiſe indierectly, ſaith he. Therfore this law is iniuſt, as being preiudiciall to the law of God and holy Church.</p>
            <p>Some I know will be carping at me for affirming father <hi>Parſons</hi> to be the author of that Catholicke letter; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſhamed (as may be thought) of the ſlender and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient clearing the important matter of the Oath, by

But will they nill they, it is ſo well knowne to be his, and was to the Inquiſition in Rome (if I haue not bene miſinformed, and by a verie credible perſon, that heard it from a gentleman, preſent in the citie in his life time, and at his death) that he could not denie it; and vpon the acknowledgement thereof (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſorrow and griefe for ſome points vnaduiſedlie or erroneouſly written, and brought in queſtion in his old age; or ſomewhat elſe in ſome other booke of his againſt Doctor <hi>Morton,</hi> touching the lawfulneſſe of the Oath of Supremacie in ſome caſe, I cannot ſay) ſoone after fell ſicke, and died within eight daies.

            <p>Such is this law of the Oath of allegiance, made by full authoritie in Parliament, for the conſeruation of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and whole commonwealth in tranquillitie and peace,<note place="margin">Tho. 22. q. 67.2.4.

When I ſay full authoritie, I meane, in temporals; for ſo the Prince hath, and onely in temporals in the common wealth: no leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope in ſpirituals in the patrimonie of the Church. Which law was generaly enacted for all Engliſh ſubiects, though principally intended as a diſtinctiue ſigne to detect, not Catholickes from Proteſtants, nor ſuch as denie the Kings ſpirituall ſupremacie in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, from the Popes ſpirituall primacy, as Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in <hi>Tortus</hi> affirmeth; but turbulent ſpirited Catholickes (and theſe to repreſſe) from milde and dutifully affected ſubiects of the ſame religion: ſuch as diſliking haply in words that moſt horrible conſpiracy of Gunpowder King-ſlaying, would in heart haue applauded the euent, from thoſe who
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20220:40"/>in affliction for their conſcience, with patient perſeuerance to the end, how long ſoeuer God permit it to continue for our ſinnes, will in word and deede loue their enemies, beare wrongs without murmuring, and ſincerely pray for the conuerſion of their perſecutors, if they haue any, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the example and doctrine of our bleſſed Sauiour and his holy Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>That our dread Soueraigne in ſetting forth this Oath by Act of Parliament, hath not exceeded the limites of his power, is manifeſt, in that it was framed onely for this end, that his Maieſties ſubiects ſhould thereby make cleare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their reſolution,<note place="margin">Praefat monit.

And withall declared, that the vertue or force of this Oath was no other, then that the Popes excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation might not miniſter a iuſt and lawfull cauſe vnto his ſubiects to attempt any thing by open or priuie conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies againſt his Maieſtie or ſtate.

            <p>If then it be ſo that nothing is contained in this Oath, but what appertaineth to naturall allegiance, nor more by his Maieſtie required then profeſſion of ciuill and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall obedience, which nature preſcribeth to all borne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects (as his Maieſtie the interpreter of his owne law hath moſt ſufficiently in his Premonition and Apologie made knowne to all by his pen) nor that he intended by interla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:20220:40"/>or mingling any thing, to detract from the ſpirituall authoritie of the Pope, no not indirectly, nor againſt the law of God, as is likewiſe manifeſt, none can iuſtly ſay he hath exceeded his limits, or that the law is vniuſt.</p>
            <p>And wheras the Catholick letter hath: That there are ſome things (but ſpecifying none of thoſe ſome) concerning the limitation of his Holineſſe authoritie (if he meane ſpirituall, it is vntrue) to wit, what he cannot do towards his Maieſtie or his ſucceſſours in any caſe whatſoeuer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That is a gloſſe of his owne inuention beſide the text, a notorious vntruth; for there are no ſuch words to be found in the Oath, as, <hi>In any caſe whatſoeuer.</hi> Neither is the Popes ſpirituall authoritie li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited or once touched therein, as by his Maieſties intention ſufficiently made knowne vnto vs, doth manifeſtly appeare. And <hi>Caietan</hi> teacheth that in ſuch like caſe, if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the man that commandeth may be knowne,<note place="margin">Caietan ver. praecepti trangreſſio.</note> it is inough; becauſe the force of the precept dependeth of the intention of him that commandeth. Now to end this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I wiſh you to note the fraude of that Catholicke letter writer: for, to haue ſet downe in plaine termes, that his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe may depoſe his Maieſtie, diſpoſe his kingdomes to whom he liſt, licence ſubiects to raiſe tumults, take armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, or murther him, and ſuch like, he knew would ſound to good ſubiects moſt odious: therefore he thought it to be a point of policie not to deale plainely, but leaue the Reader perplexed with this obſcuritie: What his Holineſſe cannot do towards his Maieſtie, in any caſe whatſoeuer. Whoſe bare aſſertion without proofe, or truth, can in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon conuince none but ſuch as want their common ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Now that it hath bene proued, nothing to be contained in the Oath againſt the law of God, nor decrees of any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell; and that his Maieſtie in making this law, and requiting of his ſubiects the performance thereof ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his intention (which is but iuſt and good) hath not gone beyond his bounds: will any yet be ſo wilfully blind as not to ſee, that by the immaculate law of God he is bound in conſcience to render to <hi>Caeſar</hi> that is <hi>Caeſars?</hi> to be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:20220:41"/>obedient to higher powers, as well the ciuill in temporals, as the Eccleſiaſticall power in ſpirituals? Saint <hi>Peter</hi> prince of the Apoſtles taught this doctrine to the Chriſtians of the primitiue Church, that they ſhould ſubmit themſelues and be obedient to ſecular Princes and Magiſtrates, though they were heathens.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Subiecti igitur eſtote omni humanae creaturae propter Deum: ſiue Regiquaſi praecellenti, ſiue Ducibus tamquam ab eo miſſis, &amp;c.</hi> Be ſubiect therefore to euery humane crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for God: whether it be to the King, as excelling, or to rulers as ſent by him to the reuenge of malefactors, but to the praiſe of the good; for ſo is the will of God, that doing wel you may make the ignorance of vnwiſe men to be dum. And a little after, exhorting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to feare God, his next leſſon is, to honor the King: <hi>Deum timete: Regem honorificate.</hi> How I pray you is a King honoured, when his iuſt precept is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected or contemned? Some haply without conſideration, both ignorantly &amp; vnwiſely wil grant that Catholick kings are to be honoured and obeyed, but doubt may be made of ſuch as by the Church are reputed, or rather condemned heretikes, and aduerſaries to the Catholicke faith.</p>
            <p>I aske theſe (if there be any ſo ſimple) whether Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, Kings, and Princes, to whom the Apoſtles preached this ſubiection and obedience, were not aduerſaries, yea and perſecutors of the Catholicke faith, and continued ſuch the ſpace of more then three hundred yeares? howbeit the Chriſtians of thoſe dayes, inſtructed both by the doctrine and example of the Apoſtles, in all dutifull humilitie, did not giue freely, but rendred to <hi>Caeſar</hi> his due, how peruerſe ſoeuer their Gouernours were. Which leſſon Saint <hi>Peter</hi> their chiefe Paſtor, immediatly after in the ſame chapter had taught them: <hi>Serui ſubditi eſtote in omni timore dominis, non tantum bonis &amp; modeſtis, ſedetiam dyſcolis.</hi> Seruants be ſubiect in all feare to your maiſters, not onely to the good and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, but alſo to the wayward.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20220:41"/>with feare and trembling, in the ſimplicitie of your heart, as to Chriſt, not ſeruing to the eye, as it were pleaſing men, but as the ſeruants of Chriſt, doing the will of God from the heart, with a good will ſeruing as to our Lord, and not to men.</p>
            <p>If ſeruants then commanded by the Apoſtle, were bound to ſerue and obey their temporall Lords and maiſters with ſuch care and diligence, were they neuer ſo froward and wicked Pagans (for ſuch no doubt many Chriſtians did ſerue) who by their examples, threats, or enticements might hazard to withdraw them from the true worſhip of God: are not ſubjects now by the ſame law as well bound to be obedient to lawfull Kings and Princes, be they neuer ſo wicked in manners, or oppoſite to faith and Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as heretikes and apoſtates are? Were they not Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Princes and Poteſtates whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> willed <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> to admoniſh Chriſtians to obey at a word? <hi>Admone il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Principibus &amp; Poteſtatibus ſubditos eſſe, dicto obedire.</hi> Admoniſh them to be ſubiect to Princes and Pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, to obey at a word.<note place="margin">S.

The ſame holy Father and alſo Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> write of the prompt obedience of Chriſtians to <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtata (which may be a verie good example for Catholickes of theſe latter times to ſhew like obedience if they light on like Princes) ſaying: <hi>Iulianus extitit infidelis Imperator,</hi>

               <hi>nonne extitit Apoſtata, iniquus, idololatra, &amp;c. Iulian</hi> was an infidell Emperour, was he not an Apoſtata, wicked, an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolater? Chriſtian ſouldiers ſerued an infidell Emperour. When they came to the cauſe of Chriſt, they acknowledged not but him that was in heauen. When he willed them to worſhip Idols, to ſacrifiſe, they preferred God before him. But when he ſaid, Bring foorth your armie, go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that people, they obeyed incontinently. The diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20220:42"/>the eternall Lord from a temporall Lord: and yet for the eternall Lord, they were ſubiect alſo to the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Lord. Hereby is euident that <hi>Iulian</hi> had right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Chriſtian ſouldiers in temporals, and they ſhewed all prompt obedience, knowing that their religion taught no iniuſtice; that notwithſtanding his Apoſtacie, he being lawfully called to the Empire, they were not, nor could be abſolued of their loyaltie and ciuill obedience towards him.</p>
            <p>Was ſo notorious an Apoſtata to be of dutie obeyed, and not a king, who cannot be iudged an hereticke, becauſe he doth not <hi>pertinaciter</hi> defend any opinion againſt the Church of Chriſt, but royally promiſeth to forſake the religion he profeſſeth, if any point or head thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to faith can be proued not to be ancient, catholicke, and Apoſtolicke?</p>
            <p>Here Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will anſwer, That the Church in her nouitie or beginning, wanted forces (forſooth after three, yea foure hundred yeares from her begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) to depoſe <hi>Iulian, Conſtantius, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alens,</hi> and other here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Princes, and therefore permitted Chriſtians to obey them in temporals.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, that in his time the number of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were verie great.<note place="margin">Cypr. in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrianum.

We are not of you, and yet we haue filled all the places and roomes which you haue.

            <pb n="71" facs="tcp:20220:42"/>
            <p> And therefore ſhe permitted Chriſtians to obey their Princes in temporals, ſaith the Cardinall. Euen ſo permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as father <hi>Parſons</hi> in his letter to the Catholickes of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland againſt the Oath of allegiance affirmeth, that Pope <hi>Clement</hi> by a Breue had permitted ciuill obedience to our King; and recommended to all Catholickes ſoone after his Highneſſe entrance vnto the Crowne. As if ciuill obedience had not bene otherwiſe due but by his Holineſſe permiſſion. Who would haue thought ſuch an imprudent and ſtrange kind of phraſe could haue ſo eſcaped his pen? But it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth he had learned the ſame out of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmines</hi> writings, and ſo preſumed it would paſſe as current without controlement. And may not the world maruell (be it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with due reuerence to his great dignitie, which I haue euer, and in heart ſtill do honour) that a man ſo excellently learned will teach, that Chriſtian ſubiects, vnleſſe they be permitted by the Church, are not bound to render obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their lawfull Kings and Princes, if they become he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes, or aduerſaries to true religion, and perſecutors? Princes infidels loſe no right, but are the true and ſupreme Princes of their kingdomes, as he himſelfe teacheth:<note place="margin">Lib. 5. de Ro. Pont. c. 2.</note> for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is not founded either in grace or in faith; ſo as the Pope hath no authoritie to meddle with them. Marry if theſe become Chriſtians, and after fall to hereſie, what then? In that caſe, ſaith he, <hi>Poteſt regna mutare, &amp; vni auferre,</hi>

               <hi>&amp; alteri conferre:</hi> He may change kingdomes, and take from one, and giue to another, ſaith he. Then is their condition worſe as touching temporall poſſeſſions, then it was when they were infidels, &amp; worſe then the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the baſeſt of their ſubiects. But Chriſtian religion depriueth no man of his right: who had right in infidelitie, cannot loſe the ſame by receiuing the grace and faith of Chriſt; which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the doctrine of the Cardinall, howſoeuer he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſometime to teach contrary to himſelfe.<note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 5. de Ro. Pont. c. 3.</note> Chriſt did not (ſaith he) nor doth take kingdomes from them to whom they belong: for Chriſt came not to deſtroy thoſe things which were well ſetled, but to eſtabliſh them. And therefore
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:20220:43"/>when a King becometh a Chriſtian, he doth not loſe his earthly kingdome which by right he held, but purchaſeth a new intereſt to an euerlaſting kingdome: otherwiſe the benefites receiued by Chriſt, ſhould be hurtfull to Kings, and grace ſhould deſtroy nature. If Chriſtian Kings law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attaining to their dominions, by right of nature enioy the ſame, as cannot be denied, and ſo are to be obeyed; why not alſo if they happen to fall backe into hereſie or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie, their right not being founded in grace or in faith? To ſay that ſuch Princes or magiſtrates are not to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, cometh neare the hereſie charged vpon <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> and condemned in the Councel of Conſtance, and is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the doctrine of the holy Ghoſt in ſacred Scriptures, and practiſe of all bleſſed Saints and Martyrs; who moſt promptly without any permiſſion of the Pope or Church, obeyed Pagan Princes, vnder whom they were ſubiect in all ciuill cauſes; &amp; onely in defence of faith and Gods truth, made choice rather to ſhed their bloud, then by obeying <hi>Caeſar</hi> to diſobey God. And where ſuch a permiſſion was euer granted (as to obey <hi>Iulian</hi> or other hereticall Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour) cannot be found in any generall Councell, or ancient Fathers writings before the dayes of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> of Aquine,<note place="margin">2.2. q. 12.2.2.</note> of whom the Cardinall learned his doctrine of <hi>permiſſion,</hi> to obey till ſuch time as they had forces to depriue them of their Empire.</p>
            <p>Conſider I pray you, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> hauing receiued his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine immediatly from heauen, writing to the Chriſtians in Rome, permitted not for a time, but ſtrictly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them euer to obey higher powers:<note place="margin">Rom. 13.

               <hi>Omnis anima poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus ſublimioribus ſubdita ſit:</hi> Let euery ſoule be ſubiect to higher powers. Was this meant, trow ye, for onely higher powers Chriſtians, or heathen onely for a time? No; but for all ſorts of rulers, and as long as there be ſuperiors and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors. The holy Apoſtle in this and other his Epiſtles, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten inculcateth this neceſſary vertue of obedience, diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhorting and commanding as well ſubiects to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to their Princes, as ſeruants to their maſters, and all

Were they not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to Chriſtian religion, whom they were taught to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey? Was any ſort of inferiors exempted from obeying?

Marke well. For this ſubiection ſubuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not pietie, or religion. And he ſpecially noteth, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith not ſimply <hi>Obediat,</hi> but <hi>ſubdita ſit.</hi> And why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe power is of God; <hi>Non eſt enim poteſtas niſi à Deo:</hi> For there is no power but of God. <hi>Quid dicis?</hi> ſaith this holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to S. <hi>Paul: Omnis ergo Princeps à Deo conſtitutus eſt? Iſtud, inquit, non dico. Neque enim de quouis Principum ſermo mihi nunc eſt, ſed de ipſa re.</hi> What ſaiſt thou, O <hi>Paul:</hi> is then euery Prince conſtituted of God? This (ſaith he) I ſay not. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of euery Prince do I now ſpeake, but of the thing it ſelfe: that is, of power. And the Apoſtle ſaith further, <hi>Quae autem ſunt, à Deo ordinatae ſunt:</hi> And thoſe that are, of God are ordained. Therefore he that reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God: adding,<note place="margin">Tho. 2.2. q. 105. ar. 1.</note> contrarie to the loue of God, in not obeying his commandement: and contrarie to the loue of his neighbour, withdrawing from his ſuperior obedience due vnto him. And they that do reſiſt, what get they? They purchaſe to themſelues damnation: hauing committed a deadly ſinne in reſiſting. Which kind of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, I wiſh many in this our countrey to note diligently, and in time to take heed of.</p>
            <p>But I know ſome will inferre that this place of S. <hi>Paul</hi> may well and ought to be vnderſtood of Prelates, and the chiefe Prelate Chriſts Vicar, who are alſo higher powers: and therefore toucheth ſuch as by obeying the King in the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:20220:44"/>Oath of allegiance, diſobey their ſpirituall Paſtor the Pope. Theſe deceiue themſelues, not conſidering the drift of the Apoſtle: for if they marke well, they will eaſily ſee that S. <hi>Paul</hi> in this chapter vnderſtandeth not the ſpirituall direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the ſecular power, as muſt needs appeare manifeſtly to him that readeth the text. <hi>Nam Principes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>non ſunt timor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But wilt thou not feare the power? do good, and thou ſhalt haue praiſe of the ſame: for he is Gods miniſter vnto thee for good. But if thou do euill, feare; for he beareth not the ſword without cauſe: for he is Gods miniſter: a reuenger vnto wrath to him that doth euill.

This ſword neuer belonged to <hi>Peter</hi> nor his ſucceſſors by Chriſts inſtitution, as D. <hi>Kelliſon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth againſt M. <hi>Sutcliffe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">D. Kelliſon in his Reply to M.

We acknowledge indeed two ſwords in the Church of Chriſt, the one ſpirituall, the other tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, but we giue them not both to the Pope. For the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme ſpirituall power is the onely ſword which he hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth; the ſupreme temporall power out of Italie pertaineth to the Emperour, Kings and Princes.</p>
            <p>For as there are in the Church of God two bodies,<note place="margin">Idem. fo. 14.</note> the one politicall and ciuill, the other Eccleſiaſticall or myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call; the one called the common-wealth, the other the Church: ſo are there two powers to direct and gouerne theſe bodies, and the one is called ciuill or temporall, the

            <p>To me it ſeemeth not without a myſterie, that onely <hi>Peter</hi> among the reſt of the Apoſtles ſhould not ſtrike any in all that helliſh troupe, coming in fury to lay violent hands on their Lord, no not the traytor <hi>Iudas</hi> that with a kiſſe betraied him, the ringleader of the reſt, and ſo better deſerued to haue had his head cut off: but onely him whoſe name is ſo preciſely recorded by the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt to be <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus:</hi> and that he ſhould be checked and reproued by our Sauiour,<note place="margin">Iohan. c. 18.</note> of whom haply he expected to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for his zeale. But though <hi>Peter</hi> might pretend iuſt cauſe to be moued to ſtrike as he did, yet was his fact reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in two reſpects. Firſt, for that asking Chriſt the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether he and his fellow (for no moe of the eleuen had ſwords about them) ſhould ſtrike or no, ſtroke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his grant, yea againſt his will. Secondly, becauſe his fact had rather a ſhew of reuenge then of defence. For what might he think to do with 2. ſwords againſt ſo many, what poſſibility to preuaile? And as may appeare likwiſe by Chriſts words vnto him:<note place="margin">Math. 26.</note> Returne thy ſword into his place; for all that take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword. And in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſpell:<note place="margin">Iohan. 18.</note> Put vp thy ſword into the ſcabbard: the chalice which my Father hath giuen me, ſhall not I drinke it? By all which is cleare that <hi>Peter</hi> was iuſtly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended for ſtriking without commiſſion the high Prieſts ſeruant <hi>Malchus,</hi> which name in Hebrew, or <hi>Malcuth,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth <hi>Rex</hi> or <hi>Regnum:</hi> doubtles in my iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great myſtery, &amp; the admirable prouidence of God, thereby haply inſtructing poſterity, that no leſſe reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible is it in <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſours, as they are <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſors, to dethrone Kings and depriue them of their kingdomes,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:20220:46"/>(which cannot be done without drawing forth and ſtriking with the materiall ſword) then it was in <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe for cutting off <hi>Malchus</hi> eare. And that they ought not to vſe ſuch kind of violence on the perſons of Kings, no nor infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors to Kings, hauing no commiſſion from Chriſt to puniſh corporally, no more then <hi>Peter</hi> had againſt <hi>Malchus,</hi> but onely ſpiritually.</p>
            <p>Now to returne to the authoritie or power meant by S. <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>Omnis anima.</hi> It is moſt plaine that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in that chapter recommended to Chriſtians their dutiful obedience to ſecular Poteſtates: becauſe hauing preached o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to ſpirituall Paſtors, ſome newly conuerted thought themſelues, being Chriſtians,<note place="margin">See S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſt. in c. 13. ho. 23. Ro.</note> to be freed by Chriſt from al former ſubiection, &amp; now not bound to obey either Emperour, King, or any temporall Lord, for that they were heathens and perſecutors of the Apoſtles and Chriſts reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For which cauſe, and for that the Apoſtles generally were ſlandered, and ſaid to be ſeditious, and vntruly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of their aduerſaries, that they withdrew men from or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and obedience to ciuill lawes and officers: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> doth in his firſt Epiſtles) to ſtop the mouth of ſuch flanderous tongues, cleareth himſelfe, and expreſly chargeth euery man and woman to be ſubiect to their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Princes and ſuperiors: howbeit in ſuch matters as they may lawfully command, and in things wherein they are ſuperiors.</p>
            <p>Conformable to his doctrine was likewiſe his example, and of the reſt of the Apoſtles, who in all matters not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to faith and religion, were moſt obedient to their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Gouernours, though Pagans and cruell perſecutors: yea and their ſucceſſors many hundred yeares after to their lawfull Princes, were they neuer ſo wicked heathens or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes. When Saint <hi>Paul</hi> being accuſed of many crimes by the Iewes, appealed to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſaying:<note place="margin">Act. 25.</note> 
               <hi>Ad tribunal Caeſaris ſto, ibi me oportet iudicari:</hi> At <hi>Caeſars</hi> iudgement ſeate do I ſtand, there I ought to be iudged: (becauſe this is the place of iudgement, ſaith <hi>Gloſſ. interlin;</hi>) is it to be thought that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:20220:47"/>he would haue ſaid, he ought there to be iudged, if <hi>de iure</hi> he had not bene ſubiect to that tribunall? or that he did it for feare of death, who was ready before, not only to be bound and ſuffer impriſonment, but alſo to die in Ieruſalem for the name of Ieſus?</p>
            <p>And who will iudge this holy Apoſtle to be ſo readie to commit ſuch a crime for ſauing his life, as by his doctrine and example to teach and do that which was vnlawfull to be taught or practiſed; to ſubiect againſt equitie, all Prieſthood to the iuriſdiction of a ſecular Prince? ſpecially becauſe he was not compelled to go to Ieruſalem, to make a lie ſo preiudiciall to all the Clergie euer after. But well he knew that he was then, <hi>de iure,</hi> ſubiect to <hi>Caeſars</hi> tribunall, being therein become an imitator of our Sauiour Chriſt; who in iudgement ſubmitted himſelfe to <hi>Pilate, Caeſars</hi> Lieutenant; and ſaid, that his power to iudge him was not onely permitted,<note place="margin">Ioan. 19.</note> but giuen from aboue. And our B. Sauiour (whoſe actions are our inſtructions) in paying tribute for himſelfe and <hi>Peter</hi> as due to the Emperour, whoſe ſubiect he acknowledged to be as he was a mortall man,<note place="margin">Math. 17.</note> taught vs by his example that the adopted ſonnes of God, (<hi>Peter</hi> not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) are not by the diuine law freed from ſubiection to ſecular authoritie in tributes, cuſtomes, and ſuch like, when himſelfe the naturall Sonne of his heauenly Father, King of kings, by yeelding it, ſhewed it to be <hi>Caeſars</hi> due, and that it ought to be payed by all that after ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him: (ſuch excepted as by good Princes grants and priuiledges ſhould be exempted) howbeit himſelfe was not otherwiſe bound thereto then for auoyding ſcandall, for that he was the naturall Sonne and onely begotten of the King of heauen (which they knew not who exacted tribute) and therefore free.</p>
            <p>To which purpoſe Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writeth thus: <hi>Quod dixit, Ergo liberi ſunt filij, &amp;c.</hi> That he ſaid, Therefore the children are free, is to be vnderſtood, that the children of a kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e are in euery kingdome free,<note place="margin">Aug. l. 1. qu.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:20220:47"/>children; and not of the ſonnes and children of God by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption: for ſo all vertuous and good Chriſtians ſhould be freed from paying tribute; which is abſurd, and contrarie to the doctrine of Saint <hi>Paul, Omnis anima, &amp;c.</hi> euerie ſoule.

               <note place="margin">Tho. 2.2 q. 104. a. 6. ad 1.</note> That ſuch as are made the ſonnes of God by grace, are free from the ſpirituall ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſinne; but not from corporall ſeruitude, by which they remaine bound to their temporal Lords. And ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> the Great acknowledged, both by his example and doctrine, to be due to the Emperour, as to his ſuperior in temporals; following therein no doubt the ſteps of all his predeceſſors before him. <hi>Ego autem</hi> (ſaith he in an Epiſtle to <hi>Mauritius</hi> and <hi>Auguſta</hi>) <hi>indignus pietatis veſtrae fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus:</hi>

If ouer all men, then ouer himſelfe, though Pope, and the adopted ſonne of God by grace. But ſome will ſay, that Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſubmitted himſelfe of humilitie, not of dutie.

A mirror may he be to his ſucceſſours and all Biſhops; would God he had many followers in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found humilitie, which is the vertue that moſt exalteth Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, Prince, or people to glorie. And this much of ſubiects duties to their Princes in temporals, wherein they ought by the law and ordinance of God to be no leſſe obedient, then to their Paſtors and Prelates in ſpirituals.</p>
            <p>It followeth now to know what authoritie it is the Pope pretendeth to haue, whether Eccleſiaſticall or ciuill, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe lawfull Kings, and diſpoſe of their temporals, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue ſubiects of their bounden dutie and naturall allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.

            <p>Among ſuch Catholickes as refuſe to take the Oath of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, are many who thinke indeed the Pope to haue no power to depoſe Kings or diſpoſe of their kingdoms, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit either vpon pretended ſcruple of conſcience, or other humane reſpects, are againſt the taking and takers of the Oath, as if they were little better then Heathens or Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans. And ſome ſo ſimple and ignorant, as beleeue that no Pope euer challenged or attempted ſuch authoritie on any Kings or Emperors; and that no Ieſuit or other learned man allowed or euer taught ſuch doctrine; ſo odious it ſeemeth vnto them. But the wiſer ſort and more learned know how it hath bene challenged and practiſed by Popes on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of <hi>Henrie, Otho, Fredericke,</hi> Emperours, <hi>Iohn</hi> King of Nauarre, for neither hereſie or apoſtaſie; and ſince on <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> 8. and Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as by cenſures do appeare.

            <p>But where (I pray you) lay this power hidden for the ſpace of 700 hundred yeares after Chriſt by the Cardinals confeſſion (ſuppoſe I ſhould grant ſo much vnto him) of diſpoſing of temporals <hi>in ordine ad finem ſpiritualem,</hi> no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, no tradition, no ancient Father or generall Councell in all that time teaching it?

            <p>Againe, S. <hi>Peter</hi> prince of the Apoſtles, hauing receiued of Chriſt all power neceſſary for the gouernement of his Church, which was to be deriued to his ſucceſſors, had not that power which is temporall, but onely ſpirituall; for in the Apoſtles times the Eccleſiaſticall and ciuill were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and ſeparate, as the Cardinall confeſſeth, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de ſum.

            <p>How then cometh it that Popes in theſe latter ages pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe on exorbitant Princes depoſition, and diſpoſing of temporals, when they ſhall iudge it neceſſarie, or expedient to a ſpirituall end, hauing no commiſſion, no warrant of our Sauiour ſo to do?

            <p>And it may be in my iudgement admired, that catholicke Princes permit ſuch dangerous poſitions, not onely to be diſputed, but alſo taught for truth within their dominions, and to paſſe without controlement, knowing that a ſparkle of fire lying ſmothering in combuſtible matter, if it be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and left vnquenched, may cauſe in ſhort ſpace an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable flame: ſo ſuch a ſpeculatiue doctrine litle regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is not vnlike in time to breed a wofull practicall ruine of kingdomes and nations.

Who diſagreeth not with the Cardinall in this, that a Biſhop is a true Paſtor in his particular Church, as the Pope is in the Catholicke and vniuerſall: that he may as well excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the ſubiects committed to his charge, as the Pope may all Princes and people that are ſheepe of Chriſts fold, by the authoritie giuen to <hi>Peter</hi> in thoſe word, <hi>Paſce oues meat.</hi> By which Chriſt indeed conſtituted him Paſtor ouer his flocke, marry a ſpirituall Paſtor, not a temporall, giuing him all authoritie neceſſary for that office, which was only ſpiritual, without coniunction of any other. By vertue then of this ſpirituall authoritie (the principall part for gouernment in <hi>foro exteriori,</hi> is excommunication, being <hi>grauiſſima poena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> then which none is more grieuous) no Biſhop can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue any priuate man whatſoeuer within his Dioceſſe of the leaſt parcell of his lands or goods: (that being the office of the ciuill power) how then can the chiefe Biſhop depriue Kings and Princes of their crownes and dignities, the nature of this cenſure being all one in both?</p>
            <p>Excommunication is defined to be <hi>ſeparatio à commumone Eccleſiae, quoad fructum &amp; ſuffragia generalia,</hi>

The fruite of the Church, cannot be vnderſtood of the fruite of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall goods, becauſe theſe are not taken away from excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate perſons. This S. <hi>Thomas:</hi> plainly ſhewing, that it is beyond the nature of this cenſure to worke any ſuch effect, as to take away temporall goods. And in the ſame qu. ar. 3. <hi>Sed quia excommunicatio eſt grauiſſma poenarum, &amp;c.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſce excommunication is the greateſt of all puniſhments,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:20220:55"/>therefore excommunication ought not to be inflicted, no not for a mortall ſin, vnleſſe the offender be obſtinate. <hi>Tunc enim poſtquam monitus fuerit, &amp;c.</hi> For then after he ſhall be admoniſhed, if he contemptuouſly diſobey, he is reputed ſtubburne, and ought to be excommunicated by the Iudge, now not hauing any more to do againſt him. And the ſame Doctor diſputing whether heretickes are to be tollerated, ſaith, That after the firſt and ſecond admonition, if yet he be found obſtinate,<note place="margin">Tho. 2.2. q. 11 ar. 3.</note> the Church not hoping of his conuerſion (meaning no doubt ſuch a one as hauing profeſſed the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke faith, hath made ſhipwracke thereof, and fallen to hereſie) prouideth for the health of others, ſeparating him from the Church by the ſentence of excommunication; and further leaueth him to ſecular iudgement to be put to death. Whereby you ſee that in caſe yea of hereſie, the Church can proceed no further then to excommunication after ſhe hath declared and condemned him for his crime.<note place="margin">Can. corripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur. 24. q. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To this agreeth <hi>Molanus,</hi> writing of the condemnation of <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> of Prage by the generall Councel of Conſtance,<note place="margin">Mola. de fide haer. ſer. l. 2. c. 2 &amp; l. 3. c. 4.</note> who (as he ſaith) hauing excommunicated, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathematized and condemned them for heretickes, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no more to do with them, deliuered them ouer to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall power, by which they were burnt. So that temporall puniſhment of heretickes, whether it be by confiſcation of goods and patrimonie, or death, belongeth and is proper to the ſecular power, as the ſpirituall do to Eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Which we ſee manifeſt by practiſe of all Chriſtian countries, yea and out owne, that no man is to be put to death, nor loſe his goods vpon excommunication, but onely by execution of the Princes law.

Variouſly and ambiguouſly inſinuating, that there are other

            </p>
            <p>But as farre as I can ſee, his Grace muſt maintaine other cauſes as well as hereſie; otherwiſe how can the depoſition of <hi>Henrie, Frederick, Otho,</hi> and other Princes, be defended to haue bene lawfull, who were neuer condemned by the Church for hereſie? And if there be other cauſes current to depriue Princes of temporals then there is for priuate men, ſurely the Chriſtian princely ſtate muſt needs be farre worſe then the plebeian, or then if they were Heathens or Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans: which were abſurd; when as God the giuer of all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for correction of men, is not <hi>acceptor perſonarum,</hi> but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreth iuſtice equally or indifferently to all; all, both Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and people being <hi>populus eius, &amp; oues paſcuae eius,</hi> his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the ſheepe of his paſture.

He that denieth this ſeemeth to deny the Popes ſpirituall authority of binding; &amp; that of S. <hi>Paul: Haereticum hominem poſt primam &amp; ſecundam correptionem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita.</hi>

            <p>What is this to our Oath? Is there any ſuch clauſe, for he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:20220:57"/>in it? Are we to adde vnto it by our idle inuentions? or are we vrged to take it otherwiſe then the words import ſimply as they lye, framed by act of Parliament? But theſe and ſuch like fond verball obiections, are the cauilling ſhifts of ſuch as know not how to giue better anſwers to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall points of the Oath; and perſwade ſome to the loſſe of their liues, and others of their lands and goods to their vtter ruine, (if iuſtice without mercy be executed) that it cannot be taken without deniall of their faith: neuer ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them any particular point, which it is; for to ſay truth they cannot. So then their bare word muſt be beleeued as an oracle; or elſe in fine with a bat they will beate men downe, The Popes commandement; not hauing ought elſe to ſay, which may conuince. It may be admired they make no more conſcience in ſuch an important buſineſſe as this is, not hauing the Churches definition, nor ancient Fathers approbations for their aſſertions. After all, ſome burſt forth in moſt vncharitable railing &amp; ſlanderous back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitings againſt ſuch prieſts as in conſcience haue perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their dutie in taking it, and perſiſt in teaching the lawfulneſſe thereof; withdrawing friends, and charitable almes from them, counſelling ſome, and commanding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not to reſort vnto them; as I haue bene credibly told by ſome that haue themſelues bene forbidden, and much more ſuch like dealings which ſhall not be here rehearſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ignoſce illis Deus, quia neſciunt quid faciunt.</hi> Theſe ought not to be the proceedings neither of good ſubiects, nor of diſcreete guides of mens ſoules, or true diſciples of Chriſt, who are made knowne to all by a notorious cogniſance, commonly called loue or charity, giuen by our Sauiour Chriſt. <hi>In hoc cognoſcent omnes quia diſcipuli mei eſtis,</hi>

Which badge were to be wiſhed more viſible then it is, in ſome that pretend to be true followers of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now to the authoritie of S. <hi>Paul</hi> may be anſwered, that an hereticke ſo taken, condemned, and denounced by the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:20220:58"/>Church, is to be auoided in his hereſie, to be taken heed of that he be not ſeduced by him; <hi>haereſis enim ſerpit vt cancer,</hi> for hereſie creepeth as a canker: and in humane conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo, when there is hope to reduce him thereby to a better mind: <hi>Vt ſpiritus ſaluus ſit.</hi> But as no Catholike is by the lawes of this realme to be accompted a Recuſant till he be conuicted: ſo is none by the lawes of the Church to be reputed an hereticke to be auoided, till he be by her admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, condemned and denounced for ſuch; which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer without pertinacie in hereſie. And what maketh this for them that ſay we denie the Popes authoritie? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that I (by his grace) a Catholicke prieſt, ſhould euer denie the Popes ſpirituall power to excommunicate any, Prince or people, that were once incorporated into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy myſticall of Chriſt by Baptiſme: but as I haue denied ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication of her owne nature to extend to depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and taking away of temporals; ſo I may not grant that euery excommunicate perſon is to be abandoned of all, and debarred of all humane ſociety and conuerſation. Though humane communication, eſteemed one of the common goods, is found alſo among the faithfull, as to eate together, to ſalute, to talke? negotiate, and ſuch like; yet this ſort of communication belongeth not to them properly as they are Chriſtians and members of the Church, but as they are citizens &amp; parts of the body politick. And as they are ſuch, they are bound to adhere vnto the head of this body their Prince, not to forſake, but obey him in all iuſt ciuill cauſes, notwithſtanding any ſentence of excommunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as hath bene proued before out of <hi>Sylueſter, Panormitan,</hi> &amp; others; which is not to deny the Popes power.</p>
            <p>No? if you reade <hi>Tortus</hi> and beleeue him, I know you wil change your opinion; for vpon thoſe words: That the Pope neither of himſelfe, nor by any authority of the Church or Sea of Rome, hath any power or authority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the king, &amp;c. or to diſcharge any of his ſubiects of their allegiance and obedience to his Maieſtie, &amp;c. He writeth thus.<note place="margin">Tor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>us par. 3.</note> Here it is manifeſtly ſeene, that this Oath doth not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:20220:58"/>containe onely ciuill obedience in things meerely tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as the Authour of the Apologie (our Soueraigne) ſo oft hath repeated; but it containeth alſo a denyall of the Popes power, which is not a thing meerely temporall, but a holy thing and giuen from aboue, which no mortall man can take away or diminiſh.</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange that his Maieſties oft repetition of a truth, nothing to be contained in the Oath, or required, but ciuil obedience, ſeemeth irkeſome to the Cardinal, it being very neceſſary whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men will not vnderſtand, but his Grace goeth not about to diſproue it. And who I pray you is a better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of a law when doubts or difficulties ariſe, then he that made the law? If it containes a deniall of the Popes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, his Grace ſhould haue done well to haue proued it, and ſhewed wherein. Though the Cardinall for many reſpects ought of me (ſomtime not vnknown vnto him) highly to be reuerenced, and his writings credited; yet in this matter to me moſt cleare, I muſt craue pardon if I differ from him in opinion, and write otherwiſe: not being able, after ſtudy and diligent ſearch of this matter, to ſee it ſo manifeſt as his Grace wold make his reader beleeue. It is moſt manifeſt the ancient Fathers neuer taught ſo, viz. to be in the Popes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to depoſe Kings, nor diſcharge ſubiects of their loyaltie and dutifull obedience; the Church neuer yet defined it ſo: can I then be ſo credulous to beleeue his bare word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out better proofe? His <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> in this will not be ſufficient. The other floriſh to leade away a ſimple and inconſiderate reader; forſooth, that the Popes power is ſpirituall, a holy thing, from heauen, &amp;c. is ſomewhat vainely and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe inſerted: for no Catholicke denieth it, and we that haue taken the Oath of allegiance are readie with Gods grace if need were, to ſhed our bloud in defence therof and euerie point of Catholicke faith, albeit we ſuffer diſgraces, and neuer receiued temporall benefite, nor euer tooke oath, <hi>vſ<expan>

            <p> The Cardinall in <hi>Tortus</hi> goeth on further, to prooue by ſubſequent words in the Oath, that the Popes ſpirituall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is denied;<note place="margin">Parag. 4.</note> which were enough to terrifie Chriſtian ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, if it were true. The words are theſe: <hi>Alſo I do ſweare from my heart, that notwithſtanding any declaration, or ſentence of excommunication or depriuation made or granted, or to be made or granted by the Pope, or his ſucceſſors, or by any authoritie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued or pretended to be deriued from him, or his Sea againſt the ſaid King, his heires or ſucceſſours, or any abſolution of the ſaid ſubiects from their obedience; I will beare faith and true allegiance to his Maieſtie, his heires and ſucceſſors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here ſaith the Card. is openly denyed that the Pope hath power to excommunicate Kings, though they be heretikes. Note his proofe. For how (ſaith he) can a Catholicke law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and iuſtly ſweare, that he will not obey the Pope ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating an hereticall king, vnleſſe he beleeue that an hereticall king cannot be exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated by the Pope? Nay here in our Oath (with due reſpect to his Grace be it ſaid) is neither openly, no nor couertly denied that the Pope hath power to exo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmunicate Kings, though they be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, as the Cardinall beareth his reader in hand: I maruaile he wold in ſuch wiſe adde vnto, &amp; thruſt into the text of the Oath that which no man, no nor himſelfe can find therein. For let it be well viewed and conſidered, it will preſently appeare that there is no mention at al of the Popes exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating Kings, though they be heretiks, or heretical Kings; but onely, if he ſhould excommunicate our King, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue his ſubiects from their obedience, yet I will beare true faith and allegiance to his Maieſtie. What ſincere dealing is this? Such gloſſes or wilfull additions are but manifeſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the text, which ought not to be vſed by any that profeſſe ſincerity &amp; truth. So this makes nothing againſt vs, but rather againſt himſelf. Then he cometh with his needles <hi>minor,</hi> which no Catholick denieth: But power to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate is intrinſecall to the Apoſtolicke primacie, and vnſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from it, when as our Lord ſaid to <hi>Peter</hi> as to the firſt ſpirituall Primate:<note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> Whatſoeuer thou ſhalt binde vpon
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:20220:59"/>earth, ſhall be bound alſo in heauen. What is this to the purpoſe? What Catholicke that hath taken the Oath will denie it? It is not vnlike to one that frameth an aduerſarie in the aire to fight withall.</p>
            <p>If French Catholickes be demanded, what they will do in this caſe, if the Pope ſhould excommunicate their King, and diſcharge his ſubiects of their obedience? they will forthwith anſwer, that notwithſtanding any monitions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munications, or interdicts, they will not forſake, but obey their King in temporals, from which obedience they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be abſolued or diſpenced withall by the Pope; as is <hi>in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretis Eccleſiae Gallicanae, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. Nay they will bring cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine priuiledges for them and their King againſt the Popes cenſure of excommunication: yet theſe like good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes will beleeue that he hath power to excommunicate an hereticall King.</p>
            <p>So in our caſe a man of any iudgement may clearely ſee, it is neither openly nor couertly, <hi>explicitè</hi> nor <hi>implicitè</hi> denied, but plainely granted of ſuch as take the Oath, that the Pope may excommunicate, albeit vpon iuſt cauſe adhering to his Prince he obey not the ſentence. I aske, if his Holineſſe in Rome ſhould determine to create ſome Prieſt or Prelate, Cardinall or Biſhop; and he of humilitie or for ſome other cauſe beſt knowne to himſelfe, notwithſtanding the Popes determination, refuſe to accept of the dignity, (<hi>Quis eſt hic, &amp; laudabimus eum?</hi> Who is he, and we will commend him?) doth it follow that therefore he denieth the Pope to haue power to conferre thoſe dignities on them? Or if a King be pleaſed to extend his mercie toward an offender condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to die, granting him a pardon; can it be ſaid, though he liſt not to accept thereof, notwithſtanding the Kings grant, for that he hath a ſhrewd wife that maketh him wearie of his life, or for ſome other cauſe, that he denieth the King to haue power to pardon his offence? It may be admired that one ſo excellently learned will argue ſo weakely. None would haue thought but the booke bearing the name of <hi>Mattheus Tortus,</hi> had bene in deed his Chaplains, not the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:20220:60"/>Cardinals, had not his Grace diſcouered himſelfe in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to our Kings Apologie. Whoſoeuer ſaieth or ſweareth, that notwithſtanding any ſentence of excommunication, yet he will beare true faith and allegiance to his Prince, no way denieth it, but ſuppoſeth ſuch a ſentence to be, or to haue bin. When the Pope in his writings putteth this clauſe: <hi>Non obſtantibus conſtitutionibus Apoſtolicis contrarijs quibuſcun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que.</hi> Notwithſtanding any contrary Apoſtolicall conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whatſoeuer, &amp;c. as in the Briefe of <hi>Paulus</hi> the fifth to maiſter <hi>George Birket,</hi> dated 1. Febr. 1608. or in others, <hi>Non obſtantibus priuilegijs quibuſcunque, &amp;c.</hi> Notwithſtanding whatſoeuer priuiledges: Is it not manifeſt that ſuch priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, or Apoſtolicall Conſtitutions are ſuppoſed to be, or might haue bene before granted? So in our caſe none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth the Popes exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, but chuſeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iuſt cauſe to adhere to his Prince, notwithſtanding the ſentence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication againſt him, which he preſuppoſeth to be, or elſe may be granted. If any will ſay, There can be no iuſt cauſe to adhere and obey his Prince if he be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it were ridiculous, and falſe, as all writers affirme, ſome caſes being excepted, whether he be excommunicated <hi>à iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re vel ab homine.</hi>

            <p>Now who is ſo ſimple as to thinke that a wife is bound to abandon her husband, and not to participate with him; children to forſake their fathers, ſeruants their maiſters, and not communicate with them in domeſticall affaires, if they ſhould be excommunicated?</p>
            <pb n="107" facs="tcp:20220:60"/>
            <p> If it be lawfull for ſuch, (as it is by <hi>lex</hi> and <hi>humile</hi>) why not alſo for ſubiects to communicate in all ciuill cauſes with their Prince, there being abſolute neceſſitie, beſides <hi>vtile</hi> and <hi>humile</hi> to warrant them ſo to do, according to the rule as it is in <hi>Nauarre, Quod non eſt licitum in lege, neceſſitas facit licitum?</hi> What is not lawfull in the law,<note place="margin">Nau. Ench. c. 27. nu. 35.</note> neceſſitie maketh lawfull.</p>
            <p>It is not vnknowne that <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, the late French King, obtaining the Crowne of France when he was yet an hereticke, relapſed, and <hi>de facto</hi> excommunicated by the Pope, required an Oath of fealtie of the Clergie of Paris, for the better ſecuritie in his dominions, as by their records do appeare: whereupon the chiefe of all the learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and faculties, both of the ſecular and religious Clergie of that citie, willingly without delay performed their dutie, taking a corporall oath of fealtie and true allegiance to his Highneſſe notwithſtanding the Popes excommunication, with promiſe to aſſiſt him to their power againſt all leaguers whatſoeuer (among which his Holineſſe at that time was one) that ſhould machinate or attempt any thing againſt his perſon, hinder his peace and quietneſſe, or raiſe armes to the diſturbance of him or his people, &amp;c. This they ſo ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and learned did with their Prince without reſiſtance, as knowing it to be their dutie ſo to do; and his caſe to be farre different from that of our Soueraigne (who was neuer excommunicated, nor relapſed, or indeede hereticke, as I haue alreadie ſaid, and could more largely proue if need were;) yet they did not then, nor euer will denie the Popes ſpirituall power to excommunicate. And may not the King of great Brittaine require the like of his ſubiects, both Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and people, and they performe the ſame as well as the French, without preiudicating the Apoſtolicall power? When <hi>Monſignore Fontana</hi> Biſhop of Ferrara, knowing well the now Duke of Modina (then vſurping the title and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Ferrara) to be excommunicated by name in moſt parts of Italie, did notwithſtanding of neceſſitie communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with him, as a ſubiect with his Prince, and did refuſe to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:20220:61"/>publiſh it in his owne Church without the Dukes conſent, notwithſtanding the Popes order and commandement vnto him. Will any man ſay, that this good Biſhop denied the Popes ſpirituall power to excommunicate? That were ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous: or offended in diſobedience? No; neceſſitie (if nought elſe) excuſed. So enough of this matter.</p>
            <p>There is another knot to be vntied, which ſeemeth inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble, to wit, that I do beleeue, that neither the Pope nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſon whatſoeuer, hath power to abſolue me of this Oath, or any part thereof, &amp;c. And that I doe renounce all pardons &amp; diſpenſations to the contrary. Is not this a plaine denying of the Popes ſpirituall authoritie? Cardinall <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> in <hi>Tortus</hi> plainly teacheth me,<note place="margin">Tortus §. 5.</note> that he who a little before by ſwearing denieth the Popes power to bind, the ſame doth now denie his power to looſe. For of thoſe words of our Lord, <hi>Quodcunque ſolueris ſuper terram, erit ſolutum &amp; in coelis,</hi> all Catholicke men gather, that power belongeth to the chiefe Biſhop to abſolue, not onely from ſins, but alſo from puniſhments, cenſures, lawes, vowes and oathes, when it may be expedient to the glorie of God, and health of ſoules.</p>
            <p>This knot to him that vieweth it well, will not be found to haue more difficultie to vnknit, then the former of bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. For as it is an vndoubted veritie, that no Biſhop, no nor the Pope can by vertue of excommunication (leſſe by any temporall power out of his owne territories) thruſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny priuate Chriſtian man out of his poſſeſſions, who before had right thereto, and bereaue him thereof, as hath bene proued: ſo it is as certaine, that they can no more abſolue a ſubiect of his dutie and naturall allegiance to his Prince, and of his oath of fealtie made vnto him, diſcharging him of all ſubiection and obedience, then they can a wife of her dutie to her husband, of childrens honoring their parents, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants their maiſters, being warranted for the performance thereof by the law of God, <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother, &amp;c.</hi> againſt which no power in earth can diſpence nor ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue them, that is, releaſe them of ſuch dutie.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:20220:61"/>
            <p> At this word <hi>Abſolue,</hi> ſome ſilly ſoules, yea and others that would be accounted wiſe, are as it were ſcandalized, beleeuing that taking the Oath, they ſhall denie the Popes ſpirituall power of abſoluing a ſinner of his ſinnes in <hi>foro con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiae,</hi> which euery Prieſt hauing iuriſdiction may do: little conſidering that they are not like to confeſſe their ſinnes to him this yeare, or euer in their life; and out of confeſſion, his authoritie ſtretcheth not to remit or abſolue one from deadly ſinne. Theſe in a ſort reſemble ſome good creatures that I haue noted in Italie, when they heare the Preacher in his ſermon vtter this word <hi>Confiteor,</hi> will by and by knocke their breaſts, thinking he is talking of confeſſion; when as the word ſignifieth ſometime to giue thankes. And like peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſmall vnderſtanding, beleeue, that by renouncing all pardons and diſpenſations to the contrary, they muſt denie the Popes power of granting indulgences or pardons (as the practiſe is) to beades, graines, croſſes, &amp;c. and of diſpenſing in any caſe whatſoeuer, it being ſpirituall, as cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.</p>
            <p>Here I ſtand ambiguous,<note place="margin">Prou. 26.</note> whether I ſhould follow <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> counſell or no, <hi>Responde ſtulto iuxta ſtultitiam ſuam, ne ſibi ſapiens eſſe videatur:</hi> Anſwer a foole according to his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, leſt he thinke himſelfe wiſe. It ſhall not be haply amiſſe for their more ſatisfaction to condeſcend ſomewhat vnto ſuch, letting them to vnderſtand, that to men of any iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it muſt needs be ridiculous, who know it cannot, nor ought ſo to be vnderſtood, but onely of pardoning and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencing, or releaſing ſubiects of a lawfull Oath of fealtie and dutifull obedience to their Soueraigne. This is not ſpirituall power which belongeth to the Church; and therefore when ſuch pardons and diſpenſations ſhall be offered by his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, (as is neuer like to be) euery good ſubiect is bound to renounce them, as being contrary to the ordinance of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God.

Now remaines to be diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whether his Holineſſe may abſolue from all oathes, and ſo from this Oath of allegiance. Which queſtion ſerueth moſt for our purpoſe in hand.</p>
            <p>It is to be noted that euery oath is either aſſertory, that is, of things preſent or paſt; or elſe promiſſorie, of things to come: and either of good and lawfull matters, or of euill and vnlawfull. An vnlawfull thing, and that which cannot be performed without ſinne, is not matter of an oath, and therefore requireth no diſpenſation or abſolution from it, as is manifeſt: for whoſoeuer ſhould ſweare to commit ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultery, which is promiſſorie, or neuer to pray, neuer to faſt, and ſuch like, will any man ſay that he muſt ſeeke to be abſolued from that oath; and not rather that he is bound <hi>ex naturarei</hi> not to performe it,<note place="margin">2.2. q. 89. ar. 9. ad 3.</note> being euill in it ſelfe? S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> ſaith: Sometime it happeneth that that which falleth
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:20220:63"/>vnder a promiſſorie Oath, is repugnant to iuſtice; either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſce it is a ſinne, and ſo is bound not to keepe it; or elſe for that it is a hinderer of a greater good (as not to liue a virgine, not to enter into religion) and ſuch an Oath nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no diſpenſation, but is lawfull for him that ſweareth to keepe it, or not to keepe it. And ſomtime (he ſaith ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what is promiſed, of which there is doubt whether it be lawfull or vnlawfull, profitable or hurtfull, abſolutely or in ſome caſe: and in this euery Biſhop may diſpence. But in an aſſertorie Oath <hi>Sylueſter verbo Iuramentum</hi> 5. n 2.

            <p>When in an Oath is any thing ſworne or promiſed to Prince or priuate man, which is manifeſtly iuſt, according to the law of God, and accompanied with theſe three aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, Veritie, Iudgment and Iuſtice, that ought duly to be performed of him that ſo ſweareth:<note place="margin">Exod. 20.

               <hi>Reddes Domino iura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta tua;</hi> and cannot be diſpenced withall, when as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of an Oath falleth vnder a diuine precept, which is indiſpenſable, as S. <hi>Thomas</hi> writeth in the place aboue noted <hi>ad primum.</hi> And in euery ſuch Oath, yea though it be coacted, riſeth an obligation, whereby a man reſteth bound to God, which is not taken away <hi>in foro conſcientiae,</hi> as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth. To which purpoſe S. <hi>Bernard</hi> writeth thus:<note place="margin">Bern. lib. de praecepto. &amp; diſp. c. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Illud quod non ab homine traditum, &amp;c.</hi> That which is not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vs by man, but is proclaimed from God, admitteth no humane diſpenſation at all, neither is it lawfull for any man in any ſort to abſolue from theſe; that is,<note place="margin">Ioan.

            <p>Such I take our Oath of allegiance to be, publiſhed and proclaimed by God, commanding ſubiects and all inferiors to render vnto <hi>Caeſar</hi> and all ſuperiours their due: againſt which no diſpenſation, no abſolution can be of force. And herein I ſay not, that his Holineſſe cannot diſpence or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue from any Oath, but from this particular Oath, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is nothing promiſed which is not manifeſtly law full, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:20220:64"/>profitable and due to him to whom it is made: and in ſuch an Oath, S. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">2.2. q. 89. ar. 9. ad 3.</note> diſpenſation ſeemeth to haue no place; becauſe beſides the obligation to Almightie God, there riſeth a new to his Maieſtie, which cannot be relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Pope, ſubiects, or any other then by himſelfe to whom it is made. Neither doth the Popes power extend to the taking away of the right of a third perſon in matters which are not Eccleſiaſticall, as <hi>Caietan</hi> affirmeth. And therefore cannot abſolue a ſubiect from an Oath of allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to his Prince, for that it would be preiudiciall vnto him.<note place="margin">Caiet. In 2 2. q. 89. ar. 9.</note>

Becauſe it is not in the Popes power to take away the right of a third man in matters not Eccleſiaſticall, as it is in his power to change (to wit vowes) into ſomething more acceptable to God; for that he is Gods Vicar, and is not the Vicar of that man: neither is he ſo ouer him as he may depriue him of his goods at his pleaſure.<note place="margin">Tolet. inſtr, ſacer. li. 4. c. 23. nu. 3.</note> Whereto agreeth Card. <hi>Tolet: Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do iuramentum, &amp;c.</hi> When an Oath is to the vtilitie of ſome third perſon, it cannot be diſpenced withall, no not by the Pope, without the conſent of the third perſon; as alſo the Pope cannot take away an other mans goods. Whereto tendeth our Oath, but to the vtilitie or good of his Maieſty; and to his great preiudice would it not be, if his ſubiects ſhould accept of any abſolution from the ſame? <hi>Speculator</hi> likewiſe denieth that the Pope may abſolue any man from a lawfull Oath,<note place="margin">Tit. de legato §. nunc oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum, n. 24.</note> becauſe the bond of keeping an Oath and performing it to God, is of the law of nature and diuine. By this appeareth that iuſt and lawfull Oathes, being ſuch as may be preiudiciall to a third perſon, cannot be diſpenced withall.</p>
            <p>But the Church vſeth to remit an Oath extorted by force or feare. It may be anſwered, that if ſuch an Oath extorted be manifeſtly vniuſt, and would be againſt the law of God to be taken without force or feare; no violence or feare of loſing goods or life can make it lawfull. Which doctrine is
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20220:64"/>taught in the Canon-law, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Decretal. de his quae vi metuſue cap.</hi> 2. <hi>in gloſſa.</hi> and 15. <hi>c.q. 6.</hi> in <hi>gloſſa. &amp; Extra. de iureiurando;</hi> that for no feare it is lawfull to incurr e a mortall ſin,<note place="margin">C. ſuper co de vſuris.</note> Which in another place is taught alſo of a veniall ſinne. Therfore an Oath extorted of a thing vnlawfull, the Church vſeth not to remit or releaſe, when as no man will thinke that vnlawfull Oaths are to be kept, as hath bene ſaid before. What ſay you then to lawfull Oathes, yet compelled by feare of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing goods, libertie, &amp;c?</p>
            <p>If it be iuſt and lawfull which thou art required to do, why doeſt thou refuſe to do it? and why expecteſt thou compulſion to make thee to performe that which in dutie thou art bound? I know thou wilt grant that a father may ſhake his rod, threaten to correct his child, and beate him, if of ſtubburnneſſe will not aske bleſſing, or will not do his dutie by obeying him. So may the Magiſtrate, who carrieth the ſword <hi>ad vindictam malefactorum,</hi> not onely threaten, but really puniſh and force thee to performance of that which is lawfull and thou oughteſt otherwiſe to do. And God himſelf the patterne of good gouernment threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth hell fire, and puniſheth ſeuerely the tranſgreſſors of his law with many corporall afflictions, and therby forceth many to obſerue and keepe his commandements, which of loue, without any ſuch compulſion, they ought in dutie to do. Will any hereof inferre, that the Pope or any power on earth can abſolue theſe from performing their duty to God or man, for that it is extorted by feare? Then I conclude, that lawfull Oathes, ſuch as are made by ſubiects to Princes of their fidelitie, bind in conſcience, although they be forced on them by feare of puniſhments, and cannot be diſpenced withall. To this purpoſe <hi>Caietan</hi> ſaith; that Oathes of him that promiſeth, whether they be coacted or voluntarie,<note place="margin">Caiet. in 2.2</note> 
               <hi>ſi habent materiam bonam moraliter,</hi> do binde in the court of conſcience.</p>
            <p>Whereas ſome will ſay, that Popes haue practiſed this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorie of abſoluing ſubiects from lawfull Oaths: it may be anſwered with <hi>Ioan. de Turrecrecremata, Sylueſter, Soto</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:20220:65"/>That the facts of Popes make not an article of faith. And it is one thing to do ſomewhat <hi>de facto,</hi> and another to determine that ſo it ought to be done <hi>de iure. Turrecremata</hi> ſpeaking of vnlawfull diſpenſations, ſaith: And if it were ſo done at any time, by ſome Pope, either ignorant in diuine learning, or blinded with couetouſneſſe of mony, which for ſuch exorbitant diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s is accuſtomed to be offered, or elſe to pleaſe men: it followeth not that he could do it iuſtly: (that was, <hi>Clement</hi> 3. diſpencing with <hi>Conſtantia</hi> a profeſſed Nunne, to marrie with <hi>Henrie</hi> 6. Emperor, ſon to <hi>Fredericke</hi> 2.) The Church is gouerned, or ought to be gouerned, by rights &amp; lawes, not by ſuch facts or examples. Thus you ſee that it is no denying his Holineſſe ſpirituall power to ſay, that he cannot diſpence in all lawes, all vowes, or all oathes, nor conſequently abſolue me of this Oath of allegiance.</p>
            <p>How I pray you can I ſweare truly (as I muſt if I do well) that which neuer was determined or defined by the Church, but is matter of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, diuerſly held of diuers learned men?</p>
            <p>Verie well, and without ſinne. And you may obſerue what is commanded in holy Scripture to ſuch as ſhall take an Oath;<note place="margin">Ierem. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Iurabis Domino in veritate, in iudicio, &amp; in iuſtitia.</hi> For then is a man ſaid to ſweare truly, that his doctrine of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, <hi>v. g.</hi> that the Pope cannot by any authoritie depoſe Princes, or ſuch a thing is true; not onely when he certainly knoweth it to be ſo, but alſo when he is perſwaded in his conſcience vpon probable reaſon,<note place="margin">Tolet. inſtru. ſacer. l. 4. c. 21 nu. 4. Syl. verb. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurium &amp; 22. q. 2. homines.</note> and in heart thinketh it to be ſo as he ſpeaketh. This Cardinall <hi>Tolet</hi> teacheth to be that ſufficient truth which is required in euerie Oath. And which is more, both he, <hi>Sylueſter,</hi> and other hold, that to ſweare a thing to be true in his opinion, which indeed is falſe, is no ſinne at all, if he did his beſt endeuour and vſed due diligence to know the truth. As, if one ſay as he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, that <hi>Peter</hi> is dead,<note place="margin">Greg. de Val. diſp. 6. q. 7. de iuramento.</note> and ſhould ſweare it: he neither ſpeaketh, nor ſweareth vntruly, becauſe his words are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his interior mind. Which is ſufficient accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> alſo, as <hi>Sylueſter</hi> noteth, to be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted truth, the principal point of an oath. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:20220:65"/>For it is required that he who ſweareth, ſweare not lightly or vainely, but diſcreetly, vpon conſideration of ſome neceſſarie or profitable cauſe. The third is Iuſtice, to wit, that it be not vniuſt or vnlawfull which is ſworne. Which being ſo, how can any man be worthily reproued of ſinne that taketh the Oath of allegiance, vpon a moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie &amp; profitable cauſe as all know, of remouing therby an imputation of treacherie and treaſon, and pacifying what in him lieth his Maieſties heauie diſpleaſure, worthily concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for the moſt deteſtable Gunpowder practiſe: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is perſwaded, after great dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vſed, to be both true, at leaſt in his iudgement, and alſo verie lawfull, as is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects loyaltie to his Prince? Hereupon I ſee no reaſon why this Oath may not be taken of all Catholickes without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſin, and ought of euery good ſubiect being required thereto: in the wilfull refuſers whereof his Maieſtie hath iuſt cauſe to ſuſpect a hidden miſchiefe to lie, if euer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunite ſhould ſerue. By this is cleare, that what a man <hi>ex animo</hi> thinketh to be true, he may truly ſay, yea and ſweare too; it being a moſt certaine principle, well in reaſon as in diuinitie, and noted by father <hi>Parſons</hi> in his Catholicke let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that what a man may truly ſay, he may alſo truly ſweare: but he may truly ſay, that a probable opinion held &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ſundry learned men Catholikes, is true, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth not another probable opinion taught by others as learned and as good. For example, That our bleſſed Lady the mother of God was free from being conceiued in ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſin: which opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was defined in the Councell of Baſil Seſſ. 36. and ſtifly maintained by the Franſciſcan family.

No doubt but this holy and leaned man would haue ſworne, if occaſion had bene offered, that his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion was true, becauſe it was ſuch as he thought. So may any in this our caſe of the Oath of allegiance, ſweare no leſſe truly then they, hauing good Authors, and all antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for their opinion. Many like inſtances might be here
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:20220:66"/>produced of the diuerſitie of doctrine betweene S. <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> and their ſchollers, who peremptorily will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their doctrine againſt each others, yet all agreeing <hi>in vnitate fidei:</hi> but theſe ſhall ſuffice.</p>
            <p>After all this followeth another point, no leſſe difficult then any of the reſt of the Oath, that is: And I do further ſweare, that I do from my heart abhorre, deteſt and abiure, as impious and hereticall, this damnable doctrine and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fition, that Princes which be excommunicated or depriued by the Pope, may be depoſed or murthered by their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, or any other whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>Some peraduenture not duly conſidering what they heare or reade concerning this point of the Oath, finding the words (Pope) and (excommunicated,) perſwade themſelues aſſuredly, that to take this clauſe, is abſolutely to renounce the Pope, and denie his power to excommunicate. Others of better vnderſtanding conceiue rightly, that ſuch autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is rather preſuppoſed and granted to be in him, then denied: but to abiure (which in this place ſignifieth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie with an oath) a doctrine as hereticall, that is, to ſweare it is hereſie, which hath not bene determined or defined by the Church, ſeemeth very hard and vnlawfull to be ſworne. For anſwer, you ſhall firſt vnderſtand, that a man may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre, or deteſt a doctrine, as he would deteſt yea hereſie it ſelfe, yet not affirme the doctrine which he ſo deteſteth to be hereſie. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>.g.</hi> If any ſhould deteſt the doctrine of S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> and of the Dominicans,<note place="margin">Tho. 3. p.q. 27. ar. 2.</note> which deny the conception of our B. Lady to be free from originall ſin; or that of the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons in Paris, holding peremptorily(as I haue ſaid) a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell to be aboue the Pope; will any man of iudgement ſay, that the poſition is her eſie, and they hereticks? <hi>Coſterus</hi> and other learned men do cleare them from ſuch a note, and they are ſtill ready to defend themſelues againſt any that ſhall accuſe them thereof. Likewiſe if any abhorre drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, detraction, ſowing diſcord betweene brethren and friends, as he abhorreth hereſie; can it be ſaid that drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, detraction, or ſowing diſcord (though they be
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:20220:67"/>great ſins, and abound in too too many) is hereſie? it were too fond and childiſh. This <hi>As,</hi> ſignifieth here a ſimilitude, not an equalitie. and all know, that <hi>nullum ſimile eſt idem;</hi> which may ſerue for one anſwer.</p>
            <p>And for a ſecond, let it be granted, that ſuch as ſweare, thinke it indeed to be heretical doctrine (albeit the Church hath not defined it ſo,) that Princes which be excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated or depriued by the Pope, may be depoſed or murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by their ſubiects, &amp;c. what abſurditie is like to follow? I haue already (as I truſt) ſufficiently proued, that neither Biſhops nor the Pope, by their ſpirituall cenſure, haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to diſpoſſeſſe any priuate man or Prince, be he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo peruerſe an hereticke, of his lands, goods, or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dominions; for that it is againſt the eſſence or nature of excommunication to worke ſuch an effect. It is likewiſe proued to be againſt the law of God, for children, ſeruants and ſubiects to diſobey their parents, maiſters and Princes, commanding iuſtly: notwithſtanding any excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion denounced againſt them, which is the Churches peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, beyond which ſhe may not go; it being onely a depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the common goods of the Church appertaining to Chriſtians. Now what doctrine ſoeuer is repugnant to Scripture, euery word thereof being <hi>de fide.</hi> may well be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted hereſie, and as ſuch abhorred and abiured: for <hi>hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſis eſt circa ea quae ſunt fidei,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tho. 2.2. q. 11. ar.2.</note> hereſie is about thoſe things which belong vnto, or are of faith. Such is the dutie of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to their lawfull Prince, and of all inferiors to their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors. Then is it hereſie directly to ſay, that it is lawfull for ſubiects, or any other whatſoeuer, who is not his Iudge and ſuperior in that kind, to murther him; it being expreſly againſt a diuine precept, <hi>Non occides,</hi> and this ſaying of our Sauiour,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note>

            <p>And in my iudgement it may be admited, that any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick wil ſtick at this point, here being no mention of the Popes depoſing (that which many ſtand vpon,) but of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, or any other whatſoeuer; vnleſſe they will ranke him among theſe, <hi>whatſoeuer,</hi> which ought not ſo to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. But if they will vnder this generall word vnderſtand alſo the Pope, yet may it be ſaid, it is hereſie, to wit, <hi>May be murthered;</hi> which cannot be vnderſtood but of killing vniuſtly, and without authoritie. If you ſay, that the other part, <hi>May be depoſed,</hi> was neuer declared, nor adiudged he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and therefore the Oath cannot be taken, becauſe <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> is <hi>ex integra cauſa,</hi> and <hi>malum ex ſingulis defectibus:</hi> then one part not being hereticall. how can this clauſe be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſworne, <hi>that Princes which be excommunicated, may be depoſed,</hi> to be damnable and hereticall doctrine?</p>
            <p>This indeed is ſuch an obiection, as in the iudgement of diuers cannot be anſwered, and whereupon many pretend to haue great reaſon to ſtand: but let all paſſion be layd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, lending me an indifferent care, &amp; with Gods aſſiſtance ſuch a ſolution may be framed, as ſhall ſatisfie I truſt and ſolue the difficultie.</p>
            <p>In our Oath, no man ſweareth, nor is vrged to ſweare, nor by the law ought to ſweare further then the expreſſe words of the Oath, which are after this ſort; as is alſo noted before, pag. 119.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I do further ſweare, that I do from my heart abhorre, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and abiure as impious and hereticall,</hi> What? Note wel, <hi>this damnable doctrine and poſition,</hi> What poſition? Forſooth, <hi>that Princes which be excommunicated or depriued by the Pope, may be depoſed or murthered by their ſubiects, &amp;c.</hi> This poſition is ſworne, not <hi>per partes,</hi> by peecemeale, but coniunctiuely and wholly as it lieth: and ſo, it cannot be denied but it is impious and hereticall doctrine; hereſie here being affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:20220:68"/>not on the parts of the poſition ſeparated, but on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> hole together.</p>
            <p>For in a ſentence affirmatiue, diſiunctiue propoſition, or booke, if any part be defectuous, falſe, or hereticall, albeit ſome part thereof be true, and ſound doctrine; it may wel be ſaid, that the whole ſentence, propoſition or booke is defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous; falſe,<note place="margin">Gresſ. l. 1. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider. Pag. 47.</note> or hereticall, as <hi>Gretſerus</hi> writeth. Then that, <hi>May be depoſed;</hi> cloſed in one propoſition with the other part; <hi>or murthered,</hi> which is hereticall; the whole poſition as it lieth muſt needes ber ſaid, and may be ſworne to be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall. For example, The Inquiſition vſeth to condemne as a ſcandalous or hereticall booke, if there be but one onely Chapter or ſentence of ſcandalous or hereticall doctrine contained therein, though all the reſt be found and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke. And may not any man lawfully ſweare, that booke ſo condemned, to be ſcandalous or hereticall, albeit all the whole is not ſuch? or that man to be an hereticke, which er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth againſt one onely article of the Catholicke faith?</p>
            <p>But if the two parts of the propoſition you thinke are ſworne <hi>diuiſim</hi> and by parts, not <hi>coniunctim</hi> or totally to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; then let <hi>impious</hi> go with the firſt part <hi>may be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;</hi> and <hi>hereticall</hi> with the latter <hi>or murthered;</hi> and I cannot ſee how you can deny, but ſo it may beſworne.</p>
            <p>If any will yet ſtand vpon the word <hi>abiure;</hi> as I heare many do, ſaying, It ſignifieth not onely ſimply to deny a thing with an oath, as al Dictionaries vnderſtand the word, but by oath to deny that which once he held before: then, he that neuer held the doctrine and poſition aboue named, cannot take this Oath, becauſe he may not abiure that opinion which he neuer held.</p>
            <p>But this will manifeſtly appeare, to him that hath any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the practiſe of the Church, to be falſe. For, let any be conuented into the Inquiſition for any one hereſie whatſoeuer, as Anabaptiſme; Browniſme, &amp;c, if afterwards he repent and conuert to the Catholicke faith, he ſhall be required; and muſt of neceſſitie abiure, not onely that impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or hereſie of Anabaptiſme or Browniſme, which
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:20220:68"/>he held before, but alſo all other hereſies, as Pelagianiſme, Arianiſme, Neſtorianiſme, &amp;c. which haply he had alwayes before deteſted. This therefore is but a vaine verball ſhift of ſome who not knowing what to ſay againſt the maine points of the Oath, are driuen out of the profundity of their wits to ſeeke a knot in a ruſh, to inuent a difficultie where none is, therby to intrap the ſoules of ſcrupulous conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and deterre them from performing their dutie to their Prince, making no conſcience to ouerthrow them alſo in their temporals.</p>
            <p>If any inſift ſaying, that they thinke indeed the doctrine, which teacheth it to be no ſin to depoſe or murther a good and lawfull King, ſuch a one as gouerneth for the good of the common<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>wealth, to be hereticall: but if he become a tyrant, ſuch a one as hath more care of his owne vtilitie then of the weale publicke, and ſeeketh to ſubuert the State, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteth the profeſſours of the true religion, and ſets vp ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie in ſteed of Chriſtian faith in the iudgement of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; it is not hereſie to teach, that he may be depoſed by the State aſſembled, or lawfully murthered by any man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.</p>
            <p>And is not this pernicious doctrine of many ſectaries of this age hereſie? It being directly repugnant to the doctrine and example of our Sauiour Chriſt and his Apoſtles, againſt the law giuen to <hi>Moſes, Thou ſhalt not kill;</hi> as alſo againſt that ſaying of our Lord, <hi>Qui acceperit gladium, gladio peribit:</hi> Whoſoeuer ſhall take the ſword (to ſtrike withall without authority) ſhal periſh with the ſword.

            <p>Sir, what ſay you then to the Friars killing his liege Lord Henrie the third of France, the mod Chriſtian King, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be a tyrant in gouernement, and a fauourer of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes; applauded or allowed of (as ſeemeth to ſome) by Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5. in his oration made in a ſecret Conſiſtorie before the Cardinals, anone after the certaine newes of the act, and the Kings death?</p>
            <p>My opinion is, that as the doctrine teaching to be no ſinne to kill a tyrant, is worthily condemned as impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and hereticall: (which you haue heard ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the precedent pages,) ſo ſuch a fact, of ſuch a one, in ſuch ſort, muſt needs be moſt impious and damnable: yea ſuppoſing we ſhould grant, that King to haue bene ſuch a one as is aboue ſaid; albeit the French know right well he was their true and rightful King, and beſides liued and died a member of the Catholicke Romane Church. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer will go about to excuſe this inexcuſable fact, and to ſay, that he did it, either out of a great zeale to deliuer the commonwealth from ſuch a ſuppoſed wicked and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal King: or elſe that he did it by diuine inſpiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and appointed by God ſo to do; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth otherwiſe, to wit, <hi>Non faciamus mala, vt veniant bone.</hi> Let vs
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:20220:70"/>not do euill, that there may come good. And <hi>Dauid,</hi> a man according to Gods owne heart elected to be King of the Iewes, both by his example proceeded, and in his doctrine taught otherwiſe. For when <hi>Dauid,</hi> perſecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> yea who at that time ſought his life, came euen to <hi>Sauls</hi> Tent whileſt he was ſleeping, and was counſelled by his Chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Abiſai</hi> to kill him: ſaying, <hi>Concluſit Deus inimicum tuum hodie in manus tuas: nunc ergo perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

It followeth a little after: Our Lord be mercifull vnto me (ſaith <hi>Dauid</hi>) that I may not ſtretch out my hand againſt the annointed of our Lord. In ſaying, who, or what is he; and teaching that himſelfe, who beſt might, could not without offence lay violent hands on King <hi>Saul,</hi> gaue vs inſtruction that it could not be lawfull for Friar <hi>Clement</hi> to extend his bloudie hands as he did, gainſt his true and lawfull Prince the annointed of our Lord: and Chriſt himſelfe after commanding,<note place="margin">Nolite tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere chriſtos meos.</note> not to touch his annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Such kind then of furious zeale of taking the ſword, is to be deteſted in any, and to be repreſſed with great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie; leſt way be giuen to euill diſpoſed perſons to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbe, yea ruine whole kingdomes and commonwealthes, whileſt vnder a prepoſterous zeale they embolden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to perpetrate any villany.</p>
            <p>And no leſſe dangerous &amp; impious it is to ſay, that he did that horrible murther by diuine inſpiration; for then ſhould be iuſtified a moſt wicked Parricide, and likewiſe a gap o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to all miſcreants to commit any outragious crueltie, againſt any ſuperiour, Prince or King whatſoeuer. And ſo whileſt they machinate their miſchiefe, if this be granted,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:20220:70"/>they may cloake it with the mantle of diuine inſpiration, thinking thereby to paſſe blameleſſe before God and men. But who can enter into the ſecret iudgements of almightie God to know this? according to the holy Scripture, <hi>Quis cognouit ſenſum Domint, aut quis conſiliarius eius fuit?</hi> Who hath knowne the iudgement of our Lord, or who hath bene his counſellor? This aſſertion of this truly ignominious and wretched Friars being inſpired from God to do ſo ſinful, and execrable an outrage, is no leſſe to be reiected then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. For the righteous God of heauen, neither appointed, nor excited, but onely permitted him to put in practiſe his diuelliſh inward ſuggeſtions, againſt the ſacred perſon of his dread Soueraigne, for cauſes to man vnknowne, as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>Adam</hi> to fall, <hi>Iudas</hi> to betray his Lord and maiſter.</p>
            <p>Now touching the Popes oration, ſome make a doubt whether euer any ſuch, ſpecially of approuing the Friars act, were pronounced by his Holines, &amp; in Conſiſtorie, as hath bene reported, and is extant in <hi>Anti-Sixtus,</hi> or no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the rather for that Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his anſwer to our clement and moſt gracious Kings learned Apology writeth,<note place="margin">Tortus. p. 54. edit.

Nam hoc modo quod erat incredibile naturaliter, fit credibile.

Et ſanè Regum, ac Regnorum rationes, caeterá<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que tam rara, tantíque momenti negotia à Deo temerè ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrari non eſt exiſtimandum. Sunt in ſacra hiſtoria nonnulla huius generis, nec eorum quidquam poteſt aliò, quàm ad Deum authorem referri: tamen nihil eſt, vbi magis claret ſuperna operatio, quàm in iſto, de quo nunc agimus. Lib. Maccha. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>6.</hi> legimus, Eleazarum, vt Regem populi Dei perſecutorem, ac hoſtem tolleret, ſeipſum certae morti obtuliſſe. Nam in conflictu conſpiciens Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantem caeteris eminentiorem, in quo videbatur Rex eſſe, concito curſu in media<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hoſtium turmam ſe conijciens, hinc inde viam vi ſternens, ad belluam venit, atque ſub eam intrauit, ſubiectóque gladio peremit, quae cadens op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsit Eleazarum &amp; extinxit. Hic quoad zelum, &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimi robur, reíque tentatae exitum, aliquid huius noſtri ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile cernimus, tamen in reliquis nihil eſt comparabile. Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azarus erat miles, armis &amp; pugna exercitatus, in ipſo prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio conſtitutus, ardoréque animi, &amp; furore (vi fit) accen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: iſte Monachus praelijs ac pugnis non erat aſſuefactus, &amp; à ſanguine, vitae ſuae inſtituto ita abhorrens, vt nec ex venae inciſione fuſum cruorem forſan ferre potuerit. Ille nouerat genus mortis, ſimúlque locum ſepulturae ſuae, nempe quòd ruina belluae incluſus magis, quàm oppreſſus, ſuo ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liretur triumpho: iſte mortem, ac tormenta crudeliora, &amp; incognita expectabat, ſepulchróque ſe cariturum non du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitabat. Sed &amp; alia multa diſsimilia ſunt. Nota quoque eſt inſignis illa hiſtoria ſanctae mulieris Iudith, quae &amp; ipſa, vt obſeſſam ciuitatem ſuam, ac populum Dei liberaret, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit conſilium, Deo ſine controuerſia ſuggeſtore, de interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendo Holopherne hostilis exercitus principe; quod &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecit. In quo opere licet plurima, &amp; apertiſsima ſupernae directionis indicia appareant, tamen longè maiora diuinae
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:20220:73"/>prouidentiae argumenta, in istius Regis occiſione, ac ciuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis Pariſienſis liberatione conſpicere licebit, ſicut certè quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad hominem, hoc ſuit illo magis difficile, vel impoſsibile. Nam illa ſancta foemina intentionem ſuam aliquibus vrbis presbyteris aperuit, portámque ciuitatis, &amp; cuſtodiam per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſiit illis praeſentibus, ac approbantibus, vt proinde ſcrutationi, vel explorationi, quae obſidionts tempore ſolet eſſe tam exacta, vt ne muſca fere ſine examine egredi queat, non potuerit eſſe ſubiecta. Apud hoſtes vero, per quorum caſtra, &amp; varias excubias tranſeundum erat, ſaepius ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorata, &amp; examinata cum foemina eſſet, nec quidquam haberet vel litterarum, vel armorum, vnde ſuſpicio oriri potuit, déque aduentu in caſtra, &amp; à ſuis, fugae probabiles reddens rationes, facile dimittebatur. Sicut tam propter eaſdem cauſſas, quàm propter ſexum, &amp; formae excellenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ad Principem impudicum introduci, &amp; in temulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, facile, quod deſignauit, perficere valuit. Ita illa.

Debebant obtineri litterae commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datitiae ab ijs, qui erant contrariae factionis, tranſeundum erat per eam vrbis portam qua itur ad caſtra hostium, quae ita ſine dubio in illis obſidionis angustiis cuſtodiebatur, vt cuncta haberentur ſuſpecta, nec cuiquam ſine curioſiſsima exploratione de litteris, nunciis, negotiis, armis pateret exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.

Iudith erat foemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, miniméque odioſa; tamen examinata ſaepe, illa nihil ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum tulit, vnde ſibi oriretur periculum: iſte Monachus, &amp; propterea odioſus, ac ſuſpectiſsimus, etiam cum cultello ad hoc propoſitum preaparato, non in vagina condito (vnde poterat eſſe probabilis excuſatio) ſed nudo, ac in manica abſcondito, quem ſi inueniſſent, mox fuiſſet in crucem actus.

Nam, vt antea diximus, licet quidam iſta abſurdè tribuant fortunae, aut caſui, tamen nos hoc totum non aliò referendum cenſemus, quàm in diuinam voluntatem.

Quidquid tamen in hunc infoelicem Regem hoc tempore dicere cogimur, nullo modo volumus, vt pertineat ad nobiliſsimum illud Galliae Regnum, quod nos impoſteru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſicut hactenus, ſemper omni paterno amore, ac honore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequemur. De perſona ergo Regis tantùm ista cum dolore diximus, cuius infaustus finis eximit quoque ipſum ab ijs officijs, quae ſolet haec ſancta ſedes (quae est pia Mater om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium fidelium, &amp; maximè Chriſtianorum principum) Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratoribus &amp; Regibus post mortem exhibere: quae pro iſto libenter quoque feciſſemus, niſi id fieri in hoc caſu ſacrae Scripturae vet arent. <hi>Eſt,</hi> inquit S.

De quo genere etiam Saluator a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Matth. quòd illi, qui peccat in Spiritum ſanctum, non remittetur, neque in hoc ſaeculo, neque in futuro.

Licet enim, ſicut eadem est eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentia, ſic eadem quoque est potentia, ſapientia, &amp; bonitas omniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perſonarum (ſicut ex Symbolo S. Athanaſii didici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, cum ait, Omnipotens Pater, omnipotent Filius, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potens Spiritus ſanctus;) tamen per attributionem, Patri applicatur Potentia, Filio Sapientia, Spiritui ſancto Amor. quorum ſingula eo modo, quo attributa dicuntur, ita ſunt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:20220:74"/>propria cuiuſque perſonae, vt in aliam referri non queant. Ex quorum attributorum contrariis, &amp; distinctionem, &amp; grauitatem peccatorum dignoſcimus. Contrarium Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae, quae attribuitur Patri, est infirmitas, vt proinde id quod ex infirmitate, ſeu naturae nostrae imbecillitate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittimus, dicatur committi in Patrem. Oppoſitum Sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae est ignorantia, ex qua cum quis peccat, dicitur peccare in Filium, ita vt ea, qua vel ex humana infirmitate, vel ignoratione peccamus, facileùs nobis condonari ſoleant. Tertium autem attributu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quod est Spiritus ſanctus, nem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe Amor, habet pro contrario ingratitudinem, vitium maximè odibile. Vnde venit, vt homo non agnoſcat Dei erga ipſum dilectionem, aut beneficia, ſed obliuiſcatur, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnat, ac odio etiam habeat. Ex quo tandem fit, vt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus reddatur, atque impoenitens. Atque his modis multo grauius &amp; periculoſius peccatur in Deu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, quàm ex ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, aut imbecillitate; proinde huiuſmodi vocantur peccata in Spiritum ſanctum: &amp; quia rarius, ac difficilius, &amp; non niſi abandantiori gratia condonantur, dicuntur irremiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilia quodammodo, cum tamen ſola impoenitentia ſit om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino, &amp; ſimplicititer irremiſsibilis. Quidquid enim in vita committitur, licet contra Spiritu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſanctum, poteſt per poenitentiam deleri ante mortem: ſed qui perſeuerat vſque ad mortem, nullum locum relinquit gratiae ac miſericordiae Atque pro tali peccato, ſeu pro homine ſic peccante, noluit Apoſtolus vt post mortem oraremus.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:20220:76"/>thing, not done or atchieued without the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular prouidence and diſpoſition of the Almightie. A Friar hath kild a King, not a painted one, or drawne vpon a peece of paper, or pictured vpon a wall, but the King of France, in the midſt of his armie, compaſſed and enuironed round about with his Guard and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: which truely is ſuch an act, and done in ſuch a manner, that none will beleeue it, when it ſhall be told them, and perhaps our poſterity and the age to come will account and eſteeme it but a fable.</p>
                  <p>That the king is dead or elſe ſlaine, it is eaſily to be beleeued; but that he is kild and taken away in this ſort, is hardly to be credited: euen as we preſently agree vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this, that Chriſt is borne of a woman; but if we adde vnto it of a woman virgin, then following naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we can no in wiſe aſſent vnto it. Euen ſo we lightly beleeue that Chriſt died; but that he is riſen vp againe from death to life, it falleth hard vnto mans vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and therefore not lightly digeſted. That one is wakened againe out of a ſleepe, extaſie, or a ſound, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not againſt nature, we naturally beleeue it; but to be riſen againe from death, it ſeemeth ſo vncre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible vnto the fleſh, that S. Paule diſputing in Athens of this point, was miſliked greatly, and accuſed to be a ſetter forth of new Gods, ſo that many (as S. Luke witneſſeth) did mock him, and many for the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the doctrine ſayd, We will heare thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of this thing. Of ſuch things therefore which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall not according to the lawes of nature, and the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie courſse thereof, ſpeaketh the Prophet, That none ſhall beleeue it when it ſhall be told them. But we giue credit vnto it by conſideration of the omnipotencie of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:20220:76"/>God, and by ſubmiſſion of our vnderſtanding vnder the obedience of faith, and ſeruice which we owe vnto our Sauiour Chriſt. And by theſe meanes this that was incredible by nature, becometh credible by faith: therfore we that beleeue not after the fleſh that Chriſt is borne of a virgine, yet when there is added vnto it, that this was done ſupernaturally by operation of the holy Ghoſt; then truly we agree vnto it, and faithfully beleeue it. So likewiſe when it is ſaid that Chriſt is riſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe from the dead, as we are fleſh onely we beleeue it not; but when it is affirmed that this was done by the power of the diuine nature which in him was, then without any doubting we beleeue it. In the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhal be told vs, that ſuch a mighty King was kild by a poore, ſimple, and a weake Friar, euen in the midſt of his armie, and enuironed with his Guard and Souldiers; to our naturall reaſon and fleſhly capacitie it will ſeeme vncredible; yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering on the other ſide the great &amp; grieuous ſinnes of this King, and the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all prouidence of the Almightie herein, and by what accuſtomed &amp; wonderfull meanes he hath accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his moſt iuſt will and iudgment againſt him, then moſt firmely we will beleeue it. Therfore this great &amp; miraculous worke I may but onely aſcribe it vnto the particular prouidence of God, not as thoſe that referre all things amiſſe vnto ſome ordinarie cauſes, or vnto fortune, or ſuch like accidentarie euents: but as thoſe who (more neere obſeruing and looking in the courſe of the whole matter) eaſily ſee that here in this befell many things, which could in no wiſe haue bene brought to paſſe and diſpatched without the ſpeciall helpe of God. And truely the ſtate of Kings and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:20220:77"/>and all other ſuch rare and weightie affaires ſhould not be thought to be gouerned of God raſhly and vnaduiſedly. In the holy Scripture ſome are of this kind, and none of them can be referred vnto any other thing, but vnto God the only author thereof: yet there are none wherein the celeſtiall operation more appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth then in this whereof we ſpeake at this preſent. We reade in the firſt booke of the Macchab. chap. 6. how Eleazar offered himſelfe vnto a certaine death, to kill the king that was an enemie and perſecutor of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and children of God. For in the battell eſpying an Elephant more excellent then any of the other beaſts, whereupon it was like that the king was, with a ſwift courſe caſting himſelf in the midſt of the troups of his enemies, here and there making a way perforce, came to the beaſt at laſt, and went vnder her, and thruſt his ſword in her belly and ſlue her, who falling, with the great weight of her body preſt him to death, and kild him out of hand. Here in this we ſee ſome things not vnlike vnto ours, as much as toucheth the zeale, vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antneſſe of mind, and the iſſue of the enterpriſe, yet in the reſt there is no compariſon to be made. Eleazarus was a Souldier, exerciſed in weapons, and trained vp in warres, ſet in battell, emboldened with courage, and inflamed with rage and anger: this a Friar not inured to the fight, and ſo abhorring of bloud by the order of his profeſſion, that perhaps he could not abide the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a veine. He knew the kind of his death, as alſo the place of his buriall, namely that he ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombed vnder the fall of the beaſt, and ſo buried in the middeſt of his triumph and victorie. This man did looke for death onely, and expected nothing but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:20220:77"/>and moſt cruell torments, and did not doubt before, but that he ſhould lacke a graue to reſt within. But in this are yet many other things that can ſuffer no compariſon. The famous hiſtorie of the holy woman Iudith is ſufficiently knowne, who tooke counſell with her ſelfe, that ſhe might deliuer her Citie and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God (no doubt by the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt) to murther Holophernes chiefe Captaine and Prince of the enemies forces, which ſhe alſo moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly accompliſhed. Wherein although appeare ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and moſt manifeſt tokens of heauenly direction, yet farre greater arguments of Gods prouidence, are to beſeene in the killing of this King, and the deliuering of the citie of Paris, farre more difficult and harder to be brought to paſſe, then was the enterpriſe of Iudith. For this holy woman diſcloſed part of her intention before vnto the Gouernors of the Citie, and went not without great commendation of young and old, through the gates of Bethulia, &amp; by the watch, in ſight and preſence of the Elders and Princes of that place: and by that meanes was not ſubiect vnto their exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and ſearching, which is alwayes vſed ſo ſtricty in time of ſiege and warre, that a flie can hardly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examining get by. She being come to the enemy, through whoſe campe and watches ſhe was to go, and now oftentimes examined and ſearched, being a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, carrying no letters nor weapons about her, from whence any ſuſpition might grow, and yielding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reaſons of her coming there, and abandoning of her countrey, was eaſily diſcharged. As alſo for the ſame cauſes, and for her ſexe and exquiſite beautie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought before this lewd Prince, whom luſt, wine,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:20220:78"/>and good cheare had rockt aſleepe, might lightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that which ſhe had determined before. But this religious man had vndertaken a matter of greater weight, and alſo performed it, which was compaſſed with ſo many impediments, difficulties, and dangers, that it by no earthly meanes could haue bene brought to paſſe without the manifeſt ordinance, and ſpeciall aid of the Almightie. Firſt letters of commendation were to be procured from the enemie; then was he conſtrained to go through that gate of the city, which directly went to the enemies campe, the which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt was ſo narrowly kept &amp; watched in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of that ſiege, that euerie trifle bred ſuſpition, and none were ſuffered to go foorth without curious ſearching before, touching their letters, buſineſſe, and affaires they had. But he (a wonderfull thing) went by the watch vnexamined, yea with letters of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the enemie, which if they had bin intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the citizens, without delay and further ſentence he ſhould haue bene executed preſently; and therefore this is a manifeſt argument of Gods prouidence. But this is a farre greater miracle, that he without ſearching went alſo through the enemies campe, by diuerſe wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and ſentinels, and, which more is, through the Guard of the Kings body, and finally, through the whole armie, which was compacted almoſt of none but Hugonots and Heretickes, he being a religious man, and apparelled after the order of his profeſſion, which was ſo odious vnto them, that they killed, or at leaſt greatly miſuſed all thoſe Friars, whom they found in thoſe places, which not long before they had taken perforce about Paris. Iudith was a woman, &amp; nothing
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:20220:78"/>odious, yet examined oftentimes, ſhe carried nothing about her that might haue turned to her danger &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. This man, a Friar, &amp; therfore hated, and moſt ſuſpected, hauing alſo a knife prepared for that purpoſe, not put vp in a ſheath, (which might haue made his excuſation probable) but bare &amp; hidden in his ſleeue, which if it had bene found about him, preſently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further iudgment he ſhould haue bin hanged. All theſe are ſuch cleare arguments of the particular prouidence of God, that they cannot be denied or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued: and it could not be otherwiſe, but that God blinded the eies of the enemies, ſo that they could not ſee nor know him. For as we haue ſaid before, although ſome abſurdly aſcribe this vnto fortune, or vnto ſome other ſuch like accident, yet we thinke good to referre all this to none elſe, but vnto the holy will and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God. And truly I could not beleeue this to haue bene done otherwiſe, vnleſſe I ſhould captiue &amp; ſubmit my vnderſtanding vnder the obedience of Chriſt his doctrine, who had determined by theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous meanes to vnſet and deliuer the citie of Paris, (which as we haue heard hath bene in great danger &amp; extremitie) and iuſtly puniſh the hainous and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſinnes of that King, and take him away out of this world by ſuch an vnhappie and infamous death. And we truly (not without great inward griefe) haue often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times foretold, that as he was the laſt of his name and familie, ſo was he like to haue, and make ſome ſtrange and ſhamefull end of his life. Which, that I haue often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſaid it, not onely the Cardinals <hi>Ioioſa, Lenocur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and he of Paris, but alſo the Oratour at that time here reſident, can ſufficiently witneſſe and teſtifie. We
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:20220:79"/>will not ſeeme to call here to affirme our wordes, for thoſe that are already deceaſſed, but the liuing, &amp; ſome of them at this time preſent do yet well remember the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yet notwithſtanding we will not vnrip all that we are able and forced to ſpeak againſt this vnfortunate king, for the moſt noble realme of France it ſake, which we ſhall proſecute and foſter hereafter, as we haue done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies before with al fatherly loue, honor and affection. This therefore which we with griefe haue ſpoken, toucheth onely the kings perſon, whoſe vnhappie and vnluckie end depriueth and exempteth him alſo of thoſe duties and honors, which this holy ſea (the tender and gentle mother of all faithfull, but chiefly of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes) is wont to offer vnto all Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, which we moſt willingly would likewiſe haue beſtowed vpon him, if the holy Scriptures in this caſe had not altogether forbidden it. There is, ſaith S. Iohn, a ſin vnto death; I ſay not that any ſhould pray for it: which may be vnderſtood, both of the ſin it ſelfe, as if he ſhould ſay, for that ſin, or for the remiſſion or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe thereof, I will that none ſhould pray, becauſe it is not pardonable. Or elſe in the ſame ſence, for that man who committeth ſuch a ſin vnto death, I ſay not that any ſhould pray for. Whereof our Sauiour himſelf hath ſpoken in S. Matthew, ſaying, that he that ſinneth againſt the holy Ghoſt, ſhal not be pardoned, neither in this world nor in the world to come. Where he ſetteth down three ſorts or kinds of ſin, to wit, againſt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt; and that the two firſt are leſſe hainous, and pardonable, but that the third is altogether vnpardonable, and not to be remitted. All which difference proceedeth from the diſtinction of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:20220:79"/>the attributes, as the Diuines teach vs, which ſeuerally are appropriated vnto euery ſeuerall perſon of the holy Trinitie. And although as the eſſence of all the three perſons is but one, ſo alſo is their power, wiſedome, and goodneſſe, as we haue learned in the ſymbole of Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius, where he ſaith, almightie is the Father, almighty is the Sonne, and almighty is the holy Ghoſt: yet by attribution, power is aſcribed vnto the Father, wiſdome vnto the Sonne, and loue vnto the holy Ghoſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of euery ſeuerall as they are tearmed attributes, ſo are they ſo proper vnto euery ſeuerall perſon, that they can not be attributed and referred vnto any other. By the contraries of which attributes, we come to diſcerne the diſtinction and greatneſſe of ſinne. The contrary to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, which is onely attributed vnto the Father, is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and therefore that which we do amiſſe through infirmity of nature, is ſaid to be committed againſt the Father. The oppoſite vnto wiſdome, is ignorance and blindnes, through which when any man ſinneth, he is ſaid to ſinne againſt the Sonne: therefore that which we commit through naturall infirmity, and ignorance, is more eaſier forgiuen vs. The third attribute, which is the holy Ghoſtes, is loue, and hath for his contrary ingratitude and vnthankfulneſſe, a vice moſt deteſtable and odious, which cauſeth men not to acknowledge the loue of God, &amp; his benefites beſtowed vpon them, but to forget, deſpiſe, yea and to hate them. Whereout briefly, and finally proceedeth, that they become alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether obſtinate and impenitent. And this way ſinne is committed againſt God with greater danger and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, then if it were done through ignorance and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the fleſh, and therefore it is tearmed a ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:20220:80"/>the holy Ghoſt. And becauſe ſuch ſinnes are ſeldome and difficultly pardoned, and not without great abundance of grace, in ſome ſort they are ſaid to be vnpardonable: whereas altogether through vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance onely, they become ſimply vnpardonable. For whatſoeuer is done amiſſe in this life: although it be againſt the holy Ghoſt, by repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance it may be wipt out and defaced before death; but they that perſeuere therein till death, are excluded from all grace and mercy hereafter. And therefore for ſuch ſinners and ſins the Apoſtle hath forbidden to pray after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſſe. Now therfore becauſe we vnderſtand, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our great griefe, that the ſaid king is departed out of this world, without repentance and impenitent, in the companie, to wit, of heretickes, (for all his armie was made almoſt of none other but of ſuch men) and that by his laſt will he hath commended and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his crowne and kingdome to the ſucceſſion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre, long ſince declared an hereticke, and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated; as alſo in his extremitie, and now readie to yeeld vp his ghoſt, deſired of him, and ſuch like as he was there ſtanding by, that they would reuenge his death vpon thoſe whom he iudged to be the cauſe thereof. For theſe and ſuch like moſt manifeſt tokens of vnrepentance, we haue decreed not to ſolemnize his death with funerals: not that we would ſeeme to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture by theſe any thing concerning the ſecret iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God againſt him, or his mercies, who could according vnto his good pleaſure in the departing of his ſoul from the body conuert and turne his heart, and deale with him mercifully: but this we haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, being thereunto moued by theſe exteraall ſignes
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:20220:80"/>and tokens. God grant therefore that all, being admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and warned by this feareful example of heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iuſtice, may repent and amend, and that it may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleaſe him to continue and accompliſh that which he hath mercifully begun in vs, as we do put our truſt in him, to the end we may giue euerlaſting thankes to him, to haue deliuered his Church from ſuch great and imminent dangers.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Whereof when his Holineſſe had ſpoken, he brake vp the Conſiſtorie, &amp; hauing giuen his bleſsing, let them al depart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether that the Pope in this his Oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> applauded or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued the Friars murtnering his Prince, I would rather the learned reader ſhould be iudge thereof then my ſelfe: his wiſdome doubtleſſe was too great to approue by any cleare and direct ſentence, ſo vile and deteſtable a fact. Howbeit this I can witneſſe, that it was commonly ſpoken by many in Rome, that had the Friar bene a Franciſcan, as he was a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minican, he might haply haue bene then declared a Saint. And this is moſt certaine, which my ſelfe liuing in the court of Rome ſaw, that as it were to retaine a pious memory of ſuch a deed, the Friars picture was drawne on paper toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Kings, in one ſquare or <hi>quadro</hi> in Italian, and publikely ſold without controlement (to my knowledge,) which many admired to ſee.</p>
            <p>Beſides, this likewiſe is true, that M. <hi>William Reynolds</hi> then being in the Low countries (to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as to my ſpeciall friend I ſent a copie of the Oration) eſteemed it (ſo did many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) as an approuing of the Friars act. For, returning me an anſwer to my letter, he gaue me heartie thankes for it, ſaying, that I could not haue gratified him with any thing more, then by ſending him the approbation of the Sea A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicke, which came in very good ſeaſon, he being at that time writing his <hi>Roſſaeus Peregrinus,</hi> a booke of ſuch a like ſubiect.</p>
            <p>If any deſire to know how I ſhould light on a copie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:20220:81"/>when as it is moſt true, that neither the Cardinall, whoſe office it was to haue noted the Popes oration, was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided of paper nor inke, as he ſhould haue bene, had any ſuch occaſion of vſing it bene thought of before; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was not taken by any, as Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith well: let him vnderſtand, that the Oration and Conſiſtory being ended, and the Pope departed toward his chamber, certaine Cardinals, among which (if my memory faile me not) were Cardinall <hi>Gallo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and my moſt honorable patron Cardinall <hi>Borromeo</hi> Archbiſhop of Millan, who are yet liuing, with a greedie deſire flocked about Cardinall <hi>Alan</hi> there in the chamber, intreating him that he would cal to remembrance, and write what they had heard there ſpoken, to the end they might after at more leiſure reade and conſider it better, and that ſo worthy a ſpeech of his Holineſſe might not periſh. Cardinall <hi>Alan</hi> crauing pardon, besought them not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on him a matter of ſuch difficultie, for that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged himſelfe vnable to effect it; yet at laſt wonne by their importunitie (they being his friends) promiſed to do the beſt he could, hoping they would when they ſaw it, with their memories helpe to ſupply his defects. The ſame after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone he began to ſet downe in writing the Popes ſpeech in his owne phraſe and ſtile, as neare as he could remember: and when he had done, he commanded me, being one of his Chaplains, and two other of his gentlemen, to write out copies thereof; which he after preſented to the Cardinals his friends, who had importuned him to that labour. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they gaue him thankes, ſaying, that it was the very O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which <hi>Sixtus</hi> had vttered in Conſiſtory: and as I was enformed, the Pope himſelfe liking his doing therein, ſaid, it was his ſpeech indeed.</p>
            <p>By this meanes the Oration was ſet forth, and publiſhed among diuers particular friends, and ſo I reſerued to my ſelf a copie, which I ſent (as I haue ſaid) ſoon after to my beloued friend M. <hi>William Reynolds.</hi> And as far as my memory ſerueth me, this here printed according to the Pariſian copie, doth well agree with the originals firſt written in Rome: for I do
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:20220:81"/>yet perfectly remember the beginning out of <hi>Abacucke</hi> to be the ſame, likewiſe the facts of <hi>Eleazar</hi> and of <hi>Iudith,</hi> with the circumſtances to haue bene in that Oration; as alſo the circumſtances of the Friars going to certaine aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the league for letters of credence to the King,<note place="margin">Briſac then priſoner in the Baſtile.</note> his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the gate ſo dangerouſly, and his paſſage through the heretickes campe to his Maieſtie, with other like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances there ſpecified. But whether the Pope in this his Oration approueth or alloweth of the Friars fact killing his King, for that he had cauſed the Cardinall of Guiſe Archbiſhop of Rhemes to be put to death, &amp; was eſteemed of ſome a tyrant, and fauourer of heretickes; or onely admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the prouidence of almightie God, as Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> in <hi>Tortus</hi> affirmeth, I do not preſume to define, but leaue it to the conſideration of each prudent reader.</p>
            <p>What if the Pope vpon wrongs done to himſelfe, as a temporall Prince in Italy, ſhould authorize ſome of his vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals or feudatary Princes to wage warre againſt our King, and inuade his dominions, is not this lawfull for him by the law of nations? How then doth the Oath ſay, <hi>that the Pope neither of himſelfe, nor by any authoritie of the Church or ſea of Rome, or by any other meanes with any other, hath any power or authoritie to depoſe the King, or to diſpoſe any of his Maieſties kingdomes or dominions, or to authorize any forrein Prince to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade or annoy him or his countries?</hi> That his Holineſſe as he is a temporall Prince in Italy, may vpon iuſt cauſe reuenge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries offered, by attempting the various euents of warre, and thereby ſeeke to annoy his Maieſtie or his countries, no man I thinke will doubt: but can any man hereby inferre, that ſo doing he hath more authoritie to depoſe our King, or diſpoſe any of his Maieſties kingdomes, or inuade his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, then hath the Emperour, French King, King of Spaine, or any other ſecular Prince? And in caſe he ſhould attempt in hoſtile manner (not as he is a ſpirituall Paſtor, but a ſecular Prince) by himſelfe, or by the helpe of any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine Prince, to inuade or annoy his Maieſtie or his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; euery good ſubiect may lawfully, and in dutie is bound
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:20220:82"/>to take armes in defence of his King and countrey againſt him, no leſſe then he ought to do againſt any other ſecular Potentate whatſoeuer. But our Oath ſpeaketh not of the ſecular power of the Biſhop of Rome, which he hath onely by the bountie and liberalitie of temporall Princes, or by preſcription in the temporall dominions he poſſeſſeth: but of any authoritie whatſoeuer receiued from Chriſt or his Apoſtles, as he is Chriſts Vicar, and <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor; as the words of the Oath ſeeme to import, viz. <hi>That the Pope, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of himſelfe,</hi> that is, as he is Pope, <hi>nor by any authoritie of the Church or ſea of Rome.</hi> For thus his authoritie is onely and meerly ſpirituall, which was neuer ordained by God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch effects, as waging of warre, inuaſion of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, depoſing and dethroning of Princes, as hath bene ſaid before; but onely to practiſe ſpirituall cenſures, to wit, excommunication, ſuſpenſion, interdiction, and ſuch like, which maketh nothing for ſuch as refuſe the taking of the Oath.</p>
            <p>Another obiection ſome vſe to make for their iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation againſt the Oath, viz: That he who ſweareth, muſt do his beſt endeuour to diſcloſe and make knowne vnto his Maieſtie, his heires and ſucceſſours, all treaſons and traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſpiracies, which he ſhall know or heare of to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, or any of them. But to be a Prieſt, to reconcile, or to be reconciled to the Church of Rome, is treaſon by the ſtatutes of this kingdome.<note place="margin">Anno 23.27. Elizab.</note> Therefore he is bound by this Oath to reueale Prieſts, and all reconciled perſons; which no man can do without committing a moſt grieuous and hainous crime.</p>
            <p>Are not theſe men narrowly driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their ſhifts trow ye, when after labouring their wits to defend their refuſall of the Oath, they can find no better arguments? The words of the Oath import, that ſuch as take it muſt make knowne all treaſons, and traiterous conſpiracies, which he ſhall know to be againſt him. How I pray you can this be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of any who is not diſpoſed to cauill, to be meant of Prieſthood, and confeſſion of ſins, or reconcilement to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:20220:82"/>the fauour of God, or vnitie of his Church; and not rather of ſuch like treaſons and traitorous conſpiracies as were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, and ſhould haue bene practiſed by thoſe late wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſulphurean traitors? Theſe indeed, and others of like nature and qualitie are directly againſt his Maieſtie, his hieres and ſucceſſours; &amp; for repreſſing and detecting ſuch, this Oath was inuented, and the Act framed; not for diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Prieſts or reconciled perſons, who acccording to the intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Act, are no ſuch traitors, as long as they enter not into any treaſonable practiſe againſt his Maieſtie and the State: whereof God forbid all Prieſts ſhould be guiltie.</p>
            <p>And I truſt, both his Maieſtie moſt learned and wiſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his graue and prudent Councell, in their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes know, that beſides ſome few, who haue already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen good proofe of their loialtie and dutifull affection (though to their great temporall detriment for the ſame) there are many moe, who beare likewiſe a true Engliſh heart to their King and countrey, and would be ready to make alſo proofe thereof if occaſion were offered.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſuppoſing it were true, that by the letter of the law, all Prieſts, Jeſuites, &amp;c. mentioned in the ſtatute, are to be reputed traitors, and all reconciling treaſon; yet I dare auouch it was neuer his Maieſties, nor the lawmakers intent, to bind any called to the Oath to reueale ſuch kind of traitours or treaſons: which is made further manifeſt, for that no Magiſtrate miniſtring the Oath doth euer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete the law in that ſence, or giue charge to any for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting ſuch. So that theſe are but ridiculous, and the cauelling ſhifts of ſome, to withdraw men from perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their dutie to his Maieſtie: whereby they cauſe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and perturbation in the whole realme, bring ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny families to ruine, hinder the conuerſion of many ſoules, and miniſter iuſt occaſion vnto the State to ſuſpect little fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie in their hearts, what faire ſhew ſoeuer they make in words.</p>
            <p>Here, by reaſon of ſuch an interpretation made of reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and detecting Prieſts and reconciled perſons, it ſhall
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:20220:83"/>not be amiſſe to know how an Oath is to be interpreted: and in what ſort euery one is to ſweare that taketh an oath before a Magiſtrate. <hi>Molanns</hi> writeth, that an oath ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not to things vnlawfull:<note place="margin">Mola. de fide haer. ſer. lib. 2. c. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Omne iuramentum iuris inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatione ad licitatantum, non vero ad mala ſe extendit.</hi> Euery oath by the interpretation of the law extendeth to lawfull things onely, and not to ſuch as are euill. The caſe is moſt perſpicuous and plaine, that in the Oath of allegiance it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be drawn to be meant of reuealing Prieſts as Prieſts, not otherwiſe traitours; becauſe it ſhould be extended to that which is to be reputed euill according to the knowne Catholicke Romaine faith, which his Maieſtie in his learned Apologie profeſſeth no way to prejudice by taking this Oath.<note place="margin">Marc. 6.</note> When <hi>Herod Tetrarch</hi> of Galilee ſware to giue <hi>Herodias</hi> daughter what ſhe would aske, though halfe his kingdome: who will ſay that it extended to the cutting off S. <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſts head, it being manifeſtly euill in it ſelf? Yea, but in this matter of our Oath, what if the caſe be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? <hi>Emanuel Sa</hi> a Ieſuite teacheth you,<note place="margin">Sa. Apho. verb Interpretatio.</note> that <hi>in poenis,</hi> in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments a milde interpretation is to be made, and being doubtfull, it is to be interpreted to the better part, and more benigne, and more probable. Then what reaſon haue theſe that wil make the caſe doubtfull, to interprete this clauſe of the Oath not to the better, but to the worſe, and more improbable? Now a word or two how an oath is to to be taken before a lawfull magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>Whoſoeuer ſweareth to an officer being required, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there ſweareth guilefully, or without guile, which is not to be denied: Then, ſaith S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> He who ſweareth ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely without guile,<note place="margin">Tho. 2.2. q. 89. ar. 7. ad. 4. Sylueſt. verb. Iuramentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 3.</note> is bound according to the intention of him that ſweareth: he that ſweareth with guile, ought to ſweare according to the ſound vnderſtanding of him to whom the oath is made. And to this purpoſe ſaith <hi>Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> in Cap.<note place="margin">Innocentius.</note> 
               <hi>Veniens de iureiurando,</hi> That an oath giuen gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of performing obedience to commandements, is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted as it may not be extended but to theſe things which were thought of, or indeed ought to be thought of.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:20220:83"/>Which is to be meant of things lawfull. Then it followeth a little after: And if he that requireth (the oath) be a Iudge <hi>in bona fide,</hi> requiring it in a lawful caſe, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of law; then that taketh place 22. q. 5. to wit,<note place="margin">Iſido li. 2. de ſum. bo. c. 31.</note> 
               <hi>Quacun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que arte verborum quis iuret, Deus tamen qui conſcientiae teſtis eſt, it a hoc accipit, ſicut ille cui iuratur intelligit.</hi> With what cunning ſort of words ſoeuer any ſweare, yet God who is witneſſe of the conſcience, ſo accepteth it, as he before whom the oath is made vnderſtandeth: and he that witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſweareth not according to the intention of him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it, ſinneth deadly, and is periured: and is bound to performe it as he vnderſtood it. This is meant, as <hi>S. Thomas</hi> ſaith, of a guilefull oath; and ſuch a one is made guiltie in two ſorts, for that firſt he taketh the name of God in vaine, and with ſubtiltie deceiueth his neighbour. Hereupon I inferre, that to ſweare to reueale all treaſons and traiterous conſpiracies, cannot be extended to be meant of Prieſts, Prieſthood, or reconciling, becauſe it was neuer thought of, nor ought to be thought of in the Oath. Neither is it his Maieſties or his officers intent, as I aſſure my ſelfe, to draw any thereby further, then to make profeſſion of their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance; and not to entangle any mans conſcience in matters of faith and religion: which is ſufficient for iuſtification of his Maieſtie in requiring it, and for ſatiſfaction of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes lawfully to take it.</p>
            <p>After all this that hath bene ſaid, there remaineth yet one ſtumbling ſtone more to be remoued, and ſo I will end, which is commonly called Scandall. For that ſome there be that vſe to ſay, being preſſed with ſtronger argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts then they can well anſwere, they could be content to take the Oath, (as either holding it lawfull, or elſe not able by any important reaſons to diſproue it, vnleſſe they borrow ſome one, or all foure of the Catholicke letter deemed to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Parſons,</hi> to little purpoſe) were it nor for offending many Chatholicks, who are much ſcandalized at the taking and takers thereof.</p>
            <p>And is it not ſtrange for Chriſtian men profeſſing chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:20220:84"/>to take ſcandall where none is giuen? Are not alſo many other Catholikes no leſſe, but rather more iuſtly ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at ſuch as refuſe it? yea and the whole ſtate beſide, both Nobles and commons together with his Maieſtie, cannot but reſt much ſcandalized, not onely at ſuch perſons, but alſo at their religion for their ſakes.</p>
            <p>If they will ſay vnto ſuch as take the Oath, as <hi>Achab</hi> King of Samaria ſaid vnto <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet: <hi>Tunè es ille, qui con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbas Iſraël:</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. Reg. 18.</note> Art not thou he that troubleſt Iſraël? For ſo ſome, <hi>Quorum os maledictione &amp; amaritudine plenum eſt:</hi> whoſe mouth is full of malediction and bitterneſſe haue ſaid in effect,<note place="margin">Pſal. 13.</note> That ſuch Prieſts as haue performed their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in taking the Oath of allegiance, and ſought thereby to pacifie the Kings wrath worthily conceiued againſt Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes for the demerite of a few, haue cauſed a trouble and great perturbation in the Church; which vndoubtedly would neuer haue bene (ſay they) had all Catholickes and Prieſts ſtood conſtantly againſt the Oath. But ſuch loyall ſubiects, Prieſts or Laickes, may well retort vpon them, as <hi>Elias</hi> did vpon King <hi>Achab: Non ego tur baui Iſraël ſed tu, &amp; domus patris tui.</hi> It is not I that haue troubled Iſraël, but thou and the houſe of thy father, who haue forſaken the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of our Lord. It is not ſuch as haue taken the Oath, that cauſe trouble in the Church, nor forſake the commandements of our Lord; but ſuch Prieſts and people as wilfully refuſe it, and perſwade others againſt it, to the hazard yea loſſe of ſome of their liues, and of the lands and goods of others: and alſo of the ſoules of ſuch as louing more the glorie of men then the glorie of God, obſtinately refuſe to performe their dutie in obeying that precept of our Sauiour: <hi>Render vnto Caeſar that which is Caeſars:</hi> and that of <hi>S. Peter, Regem honorificate:</hi> and alſo the commandement giuen to <hi>Moyſes: Honour thy father and thy mother.</hi> Theſe, aſſure you, are they who giue cauſe of ſcandal indeed, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their perſecution (if ſo they pleaſe to cal it) is continued, the Church perturbed, Catholicke religion little regarded, and many a ſoule loſt. But <hi>Vaeilli, per quem ſcandalum venit.</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:20220:84"/>Woe to him, by whom ſcandall cometh. Time will make triall who it is, whether they or we.</p>
            <p>In the meane while we ſay, that the proper and true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of ſcandall, as it is defined by S. <hi>Thomas</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, moſt aptly agreeth with the doctrine and example, or words and deedes, of ſuch Engliſh ſubiects as withdraw men from performing their dutie to their dread Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne: not on ſuch as perſwade it, and yet remaine no leſſe Catholicke, then they do pretend in euery point of faith. Scandall is a word or deed not right,<note place="margin">Definition of ſcandall. Tho. 2.2. q. 43. ar. 1. &amp; Ieron. in comment. ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Math. c. 15.</note> giuing occaſion of ruine; that is, of ſpirituall ruine or ſinne. Now what euill or ſhew of euill or ſin is there in thoſe, who by their deedes and words, example and doctrine, teach and labour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all to do that which is right and due by the law of God? What ſcandall or offence, or occaſion of ſinne do they giue, who perſwade nothing againſt any one article or point of faith, but meere allegiance to their Prince? Doth this offend or ſcandalize any? If they will be ſcandalized for well doing, and take offence where none is giuen, do they not ſhew how imperfect they are in the loue of God? <hi>Pax multa diligentibus legem tuam; &amp; non eſt illis ſcandalum.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 118.</note> To ſuch as loue thy law (ô God) there is great peace: and to them there is no ſcandall. May not theſe be well likened to the Phariſies, that of enuie and malice were offended or ſcandalized at the ſayings and doings of our Bleſſed Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? who, being told by his diſciples of their ſcandall taken, anſwered: <hi>Omnis plantatio quam non plantauit Pater meus coeleſtis, eradicabitur.</hi>

Herby, deare brethren in our Lord Ieſus, I truſt you reſt ſatisfied, that ſuch as haue taken the Oath of allegiance, wherein no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath bene hitherto proued by any learned man to be contained againſt any one point of faith, haue not giuen cauſe of ſcandall (as they haue bin ſlandered to haue done) but by that their fact, performing their bounden dutie to their dread Soueraigne according to the law of God, haue ſought to take away that horrible ſcandall giuen indeed, by a few vngracious Catholikes in the gunpowder treaſon; and which others daily giue to his Maieſtie and the State in reſiſting the law made vpon ſo great reaſon, and for the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good of the realme. Beſides, I truſt your wiſdomes will conſider, that to take the Oath being <hi>bonum ſpirituale,</hi> wherein no euill thing againſt religion is contained, they are not to pretermit it for the imperfections of ſome, who are readie to ſuffer or take ſcandall where none is giuen.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I exhort you all moſt dearely beloued Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes in the bowels of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, (as the very Reuerend and learned maiſter <hi>George Blackwell</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time our Archprieſt, did in his letter to his Aſſiſtants, and you all both Clergie and Laitie) for aboliſhing and ending this controuerſie which hath ſcandalized the whole State, you wold deſiſt to impugne ſupreme authoritie in this caſe
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:20220:85"/>of the Oath moſt lawfull and iuſt, as hath bene proued: and ceaſſe any longer to prouoke to wrath his Maieſty our moſt clement Prince: clement I ſay, for I dare boldly auouch, that neither the Pope, nor any King or Prince in Chriſtendome, had he had the like cauſe offered by any his ſubiects, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of a contrarie religion, and finding others of the ſame religion to refuſe to make profeſſion of their loyalty by an Oath required at their hands, would ſhew ſuch mercy and clemencie as his Maieſtie hath done, and doth.

            <p>From theſe, the fourth ſort diſagree, ſaying, That the Viceprotector of his owne authoritie that he hath ouer our nation, in his priuate letters writing to the Archprieſt, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified his depriuing ſuch of their priuiledges, as had taken the ſaid Oath, and do perſiſt in defending it.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, that indeed he did it, but by order from the Popes Holineſſe.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, that the Pope himſelfe hath ſent to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt a Breue, wherein he commandeth him <hi>in virtute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiae,</hi> to depriue all thoſe Prieſts of their faculties which do concurre with maiſter <hi>Blackwell,</hi> or elſe haue taken, or ſhall teach it lawfull to take the Oath of allegiance.

            <p>Which of all theſe reports deſerue moſt credite and is trueſt, were greatly wiſhed might be made knowne to the parties whom it concerneth; otherwiſe how can they tell what to do in this important buſineſſe, and what is required at their hands, to retaine ſtill, or recouer their faculties being once loſt?

            <p>Therfore it is moſt requiſite, that ſuch as haue bin in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their faculties, granted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by authority of the Sea of Rome, ſome 20. ſome 30. yeares agone, and ſome more, ſhould know how, and by whom they are taken from them, and for what cauſe; which ought to be for ſo the great fault, becauſe the paine is moſt grieuous: &amp; ſhould ſee moreouer not onely an authenticall copie of the originall letters, but

            <p>After which admonition, the Archprieſt proceeded no further, nor euer afterwards did depriue, nor declare any one to be depriued of his faculties, as he ſhould haue done ſtrictly, according to the order and commiſſion granted him by his Holineſſe that now is <hi>Paulus</hi> 5: and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them loſt during the time of the admonition, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding his bounds, as he did, ſaying, <hi>And by this preſent do denounce.</hi> Therefore moſt certaine it is, that the Prieſts to whom knowledge of the admonition came, did not then loſe their faculties by vertue thereof. Neither is it to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, that the Cardinals of the Inquiſition, who are both wiſe and learned, can iudge them loſt by that act, as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:20220:89"/>report affirmeth, if they were truly informed, and as well experienced in the caſe, as ſome here, their inferiors in euery reſpect are. If they haue bene of that opinion, and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſo, yet is the contrary opinion of other learned men rather to be beleeued and followed, being much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable then theirs. But ſuppoſe we ſhould grant, which is not to be granted, that thoſe Prieſts who receiued and tooke notice of the admonition, were iuſtly depriued, and had loſt their faculties; at leaſt ſome others who haue taken the Oath ſince that generall letter, being neuer admoniſhed, nor euer ſeeing that, or any other letter from the Archprieſt to any ſuch end, are free and haue not loſt them: the Archprieſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound by his faculty <hi>admonere ſingulos,</hi> to admoniſh each one in particular, at leaſt to giue him knowledge thereof, that ſhall take the Oath, or teach it lawfull; or to go to the Proteſtants Churches to their Seruice. Beſides, why I pray you, ſhould not that Prieſt be exempted from loſing his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, albeit he ſaw and read the admonition, who wrote, and endeuoured what he could poſſibly to ſend to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt (as in his letter he required) to giue him ſuch ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as might haue cauſed his Reuerence to ſtay from cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring him when the time prefixed ſhould haue bene expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but could not find any meanes to conuey letters vnto him, which ſome (if need were) can teſtifie? This all know, <hi>quod ad impoſſibile nemo tenetur,</hi> that none is bound to a thing impoſſible to be effected. So then conſequently, neither did that Prieſt loſe his faculties by the admonition. Howbeit all without exception, and without any excuſe (for no excuſe muſt be admitted) are depriued, all abandoned of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes, and as if they were the greateſt offenders that euer were in Gods Church, adiudged vnworthy of the charitable almes and poore meanes which they had to ſuſtaine their painfull and tedious life.</p>
            <p>And if the moſt illuſtrious and moſt reuerend Cardinals of the congregation of the holy Office, haue taken them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, (as it is in the third report) then is it requiſite that the Prieſts whom this matter toucheth, ſhould ſee and know
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:20220:90"/>with what authoritie they do it, whether by facultie from his Holineſſe, or of themſelues by their owne power; and alſo the forme of their ſentence: all which lieth hidden in the clouds, and cannot be ſeene.</p>
            <p>Whereas the fourth report hath, that the Viceprotector of his owne authoritie by his letters written to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, depriued ſuch Prieſts as are aboue mentioned, of their faculties, is moſt vaine, and worthy to be exploded as a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged fable. For it is not to be credited, that a ſage Prince and pillar of the Church wil euer attempt to do that which is not in his power, vnleſſe it be giuen by him whom we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to haue <hi>plenitudinem poteſtatis in ſpiritualibus,</hi> ſpecially in ſuch a caſe as ours is.</p>
            <p>What if his Grace hath done it by order from his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as the fift report ſaith, is not his ſentence then to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and obeyed? Yes, I acknowledge as a child of the Church ought, that a ſentence or cenſure proceeding medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate or immediatly from the chiefe Paſtor, is to be reſpected and feared, as S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> teacheth me. Yet I thinke none wil denie but it ought orderly to be made knowne to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whom it concerneth; and that vntill it come by orderly meanes to their knowledge, it bindeth not: nor then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if the cenſure be manifeſtly vniuſt, as procured by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reption, falſe information, or any ſiniſter meanes which may vitiate the proceſſe.

            </p>
            <p>Now that this cenſure of ſuſpenſion from faculties (if there be any ſuch extant) hath bene obtained, or wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted out by ſome ſiniſter meanes, to wit, by falſe ſuggeſtion or wrong information of one or other ouerhaſtie ſolicitor, that is greedie to ſee what will be the euent and finall iſſue of this our controuerſie, is very probable. The cauſe that maketh me ſuſpect falſe information in this our caſe, is, that to my knowledge a certaine prime Prieſt in a letter to his friend affirmed, he had ſent information to Rome of as much as any of vs that haue taken the Oath, can ſay in defence thereof, yea and more. Which doubtleſſe is a moſt faiſe ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, if he hath ſo informed, and farre beyond his talent to performe. What elſe (I pray you) is this, but by obreption to procure or extort that from either the Cardinall Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>protector, or from the Pope, which would neuer haue bene granted (as may be preſumed) againſt reuerend Prieſts, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuer heard what they can ſay for themſelues, and to their great preiudice? Therefore if the ſoliciter and informer haue ſo egregiouſly erred in deceiuing his Holineſſe, the cenſure or ſentence ſo procured is of no validitie at all.</p>
            <p>The ſixt and laſt report is, that the Pope in a Breue to the Archprieſt commanded him to depriue all thoſe Prieſts of their faculties, which do or ſhall concurre with maiſter <hi>Blackwell,</hi> without giuing any admonition, admitting any excuſe, or obſeruing any order of law. So that the Archprieſt may ſit quietly in his chamber, and but ſay the word, that the Prieſts of the Clinke or elſe where, that ſhall concurre with maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> (they know not wherein) are depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of their faculties, and ſo forthwith they are, and muſt be depriued. This report ſeemeth to me more improbable then any of the reſt; becauſe it raiſeth an imputation and ſlander againſt the chiefe Paſtor of the Sea of Rome, to wit, that he
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:20220:91"/>ſhould giue eare onely to one aduerſe part, and not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to lend alſo another eare, to heare what the other part accuſed can ſay in defence of their actions: to condemne them before they come to their anſwer, and before any crime to their knowledge be proued againſt them, which would be an act of iniuſtice, and contrarie to the laudable cuſtome of the ancient Romanes, yea heathens, as is in the Actes of the Apoſtles: <hi>Non eſt Romanis conſuetudo damnare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquem hominem,</hi>

That theſe ſhould be thus cenſured and depriued by the common Father and chiefe Paſtor of the Church, as if they had committed a crime ſo hainous &amp; ſo notorious, in taking the Oath, as needed no admonition, might admit no excuſe, nor deſerued any orderly procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in law, I cannot be perſwaded, nor will beleeue it is ſo, till I ſee more cuident ſignes thereof then hitherto I haue ſeene.</p>

And then <hi>Eccleſia non debet praeſumere de aliquo peccatum donee probetur:</hi> as Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaith.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:20220:92"/>knoweth not that oft times neceſſitie driueth men to do that which they neuer thought? <hi>Durum telum neceſſitas.</hi> And now lately ſome Prieſts, vpon theſe reports giuen foorth of hauing no faculties, haue in ſuch ſort felt the alienation of Catholickes, and the withdrawing their charitie from them, (for on the eight of this moneth, for an addition to our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, it was written vnto vs by him that hath had the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of the common almes many yeares, that from hencefoorth you may ſeeke to be relieued elſewhere, for, for my part I finde I ſhall not be able to helpe you any more hereafter) as if neceſſitie could haue ſhaken them, they might haue,<note place="margin">Pſa. 72.</note> not onely ſaid with <hi>Dauid, Penè moti ſunt pedes mei,</hi> My feete were almoſt moued, but had bene moued indeed.</p>
            <p>Great reaſon we might thinke there was for vs to expect that his Holineſſe would, conſidering this pouertie of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes of England to relieue, and the multitude of priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to be relieued, knowing we are ſuch Prieſts as were made <hi>ex indulto Apoſtolico,</hi> without title of benefice, or patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, rather haue taken ſome order according to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent, to haue bene ſuccoured and relieued in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, then to expoſe ſuch to famine, by taking from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the only meanes ſome of them had to vphold &amp; maintain their vnpleaſant life. Yet if it be true that is reported, and that it is the Popes pleaſure we muſt ſuffer more, &amp; ſharper ſhowers of calamities, and that orderly courſes are not in this our caſe to be kept with vs, let vs with patience comfort our ſelues in our Lord, and ſay with Saint <hi>Paul: Benedictus Deus &amp; Pater Domini noſtri Ieſu Chriſti, Deus totius co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolationis, qui conſolatur nos in omni tribulatione noſtra.</hi> God be bleſſed and the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt; who comforteth vs in all our tribulation. And do wiſh that theſe our afflictions may be cautions to all our countrimen to conſider well the ſequele of things and times, before they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues Prieſts beyond the ſeas, leſt the like fall to them as to vs.</p>
